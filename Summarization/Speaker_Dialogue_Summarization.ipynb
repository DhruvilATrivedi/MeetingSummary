Hey Martin, tell him what we do with squealers. The hell I can\\'t! Milhouse, it\\'s not that far to the ground. And the rain has probably softened it up a bit. Shut up! Shut up! Aw, Mom. We worked so hard and now it\\'s all gone... We ended up with nothing because the three of us can\\'t share. Nothing. It just kind of ticks me off. How many teeth do I have? Allergies. And? Hey, wait a minute. I don\\'t have to give blood. I have rights, you know. Is it a Bible story? How did a lion get rich? Oh. Whoa, Otto-man! You work here? Yeah, Mom. We got hosed! You stink. An elephant\\'s butt? Yup. The last place I saw it... ...was in my hand... ...as I was shoving it into the mailbox. Dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. And I know you. You\\'re an emotional guy. Just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you\\'d be mad in the morning. So I... Give it up, Homer. It\\'s locked up tight. Why the hose, Homer? Yeah, but don\\'t other people have mail in there? Dad, the mailman is here. No, I mean the mailman\\'s here. They always told me I was gonna destroy the family, but I never believed it. Eh, yeah, hello, is Mike there? Last name, Rotch. Wow! A crowbar! Wow! A big ugly head! Awesome! Hey, man, don\\'t bad-mouth the head. Hey, we got a reward. The head is cool! Lisa? It\\'s six a.m. Something\\'s wrong! Dad died! Well, what do you know? I\\'m relieved. Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesn\\'t taste as good anymore -- Lisa did it. Sorry, this old timer does ramble on sometimes, don\\'t he? Okay, uh-huh. Okay, okay,. Okay, okay, okay okay, it\\'s done! I\\'m doing it! Birthday gift coming your way! Can do. Hm... Krusty hotline. I tried to stop her but she overpowered me. Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle! LISA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / Dad, maybe you should do this. Oh, yeah. Hey, Dad. \"Do you hear voices?\" Yes. \"Are you quick to anger?\" Yes. \"Do you wet your pants?\" Well, even the best of us has an occasional accident. HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA / Hey, you want that once a year empty gesture. You got it, sis. Joe\\'s Crematorium. You kill \\'em, we grill \\'em. I\\'m Bart Simpson, who the hell are you? The Michael Jackson? No way! Uh-huh. And is Elvis with you? Aw, come on. If you\\'re really Michael Jackson, who were your last four dates for the Grammys? Shiver me timbers, you are Michael Jackson. Can you stay on the line while I get all my friends and relatives? Well, there\\'s probably a down-size I don\\'t see. Uh-huh... New Bedlam Asylum... loves us... needs us... fears he may never see us again... Got it... Michael Jackson. Whoo-hoo! I love you, man. Hey Mom, Dad\\'s in a mental institution. No, mom, you said poor house. Poor house. Poor house. Joe\\'s Taxidermy. You snuff \\'em, we stuff \\'em. Homer, whatever they\\'ve got you on, cut the dose. Yes Dad, I solemnly swear I will not tell another living soul... No, not even Milhouse. Hello, Milhouse? Can you keep a secret? Oh well, who cares. Michael Jackson is coming to my house! Aye carumba! Huh? You know, maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask. Hey... you. I WISH YOU BETTER THAN YOUR HEART DESIRE / Stiffed \\'em? I can\\'t write a song. I\\'m only ten. Hey, Looney Tunes, this is what Michael Jackson looks like. You look like a big fat mental patient. Just leave me alone. Wait, wait, Michael! You go sit at the piano and I\\'ll boil some coffee. LISA, HER TEETH ARE BIG AND GREEN / LISA, SHE SMELLS LIKE GASOLINE / LISA, DA DA DA DEESA / SHE IS MY SIS-TA, HER BIRTHDAY I MISSED-TA. I don\\'t have any. That\\'s cause she knows you\\'re looking at her. Well, your training wheels come off your bike. You\\'re just putting that in because it\\'s commercial. Lisa... Lisa... Lisa. That\\'s right! Hope you like your present. And a-one, and a-two, and a one, two, three, four -- HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA / LISA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA / LISA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA... Yeah! Hey, Michael.

LISA IT\\'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA... Hey, what gives, man? Wow, little meatloaf men! Mom, it\\'s a nice thought, but we both know that this is the pony to bet on. Oh baby! No thank you, I\\'d rather push this button. Hey, I call first bedsies! Well, okay, which one do you want? Really, you want that one? It\\'s all yours. Whatever you say. Nothing! Have a good night\\'s sleep, Lisa. Nothing. Nothing. Good morning. This is your wake-up call. Sorry fatso. \"On this spot, Richard Nixon bowled back-to back-300 games.\" Rudy my man, you\\'re a miracle worker. There you go... buy yourself something nice. Before you kill me, remember, this trip is \"All Expenses Paid.\" Oh, this guy is awful. Cool! A ruckus! He already sang this song! Cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool... Lis, you taught me to stand up for what I believe in. You\\'re \"it\"! No electricity. Electricity only in freeze tag. Yeah, you cheater! Six. Seven if there\\'s something good on. Yeah, but what are ya gonna do? Hey Mom, how \\'bout if I learn karate? Will that we make you happy? Um, excuse me, sir. I already know how not to hit a guy. Can we break out the nunchucks? Akira, my good man. When do we break blocks of ice with our heads? Yo, sensei, can I go to the bathroom? Paying money to read books... the hell with this. Come on, Touch of death. Touch of death. Touch of death. Uh, I learned the touch of death. Permit me to demonstrate. Lisa, shut your eyes. Soon you will be at peace. Uh-oh. Gotta get back to karate class. You missed a spot. All right. Comin\\' through. Outta my way. Move it along. Step aside, lady. Today we learned how to rip a man\\'s heart out and show it to him before he dies. Hey, Lis. Change the channel. I grow weary of this new channel. Change it back. Sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old Daddly-doodly. Hey, keep your hands off my china hutch. Hey Lis, something wrong? Uh oh. I think they\\'ve learned their lesson already, Lis. Good mornin\\' world! Ow! Good morning Lisa! Why shouldn\\'t I be happy? It\\'s a beautiful day, my homework is done, I\\'ve got my mojo workin\\' and we\\'re goin\\' on a field trip this afternoon. And... looks like I got me a genuine glow-in-the-dark police badge. Hey! It\\'s not in here. You stole it! Hey, that\\'s my badge, Homer. ... Lousy prize-grabbing... badge-wearing... You ate my homework? I didn\\'t know dogs really did that. Wait! Wait! But I\\'m only... ... ... five... ten... twenty... forty minutes? That\\'s pretty damn late. Hey girls! Look at me! You can stop lookin\\' at me now. What a day. You\\'re making me lick envelopes? What kind of game? Sounds like a pretty crappy game to me. No thir. Tan Die Doe Dow? Tan... Die.... Doe... Dow. Die don\\'t. What next? Uh-oh. Hands off the material! Eat my shorts. Don\\'t have a cow. Cool! I don\\'t know. I\\'m not sure I... Oh... I dunno... mixing drinks, picking horses, cuttin\\' cigars... you know -- a job. Thirty bucks a week. I was lookin\\' for those. Thanks, doll. No. They\\'re not mine. My boss said his warehouse was full. Right in here my man. I don\\'t think so. Although it would explain an awful lot. Thanks... uh... Say, are you guys crooks? No. Uh-uh. I guess that\\'s okay. Hell no! Supoib. THOSE FINGERS THROUGH MY HAIR / THAT SLY COME HITHER STARE / THAT STRIPS MY CONSCIENCE BARE / IT\\'S WITCHCRAFT - GIMME THREE FINGERS OF MILK, MA. More \"stink lines\" boys. You ain\\'t seen nothin\\'. Now beat it. Lousy Skinner. Of course I\\'m late for work. How can I be on time when Principal Skinner keeps me after school? He sure is, Patrone. Uh-oh. That is not funny, Lewis. That\\'s not true! It\\'s just a rumor! You\\'re engaged in speculation. I know the law. You can\\'t prove anything. Reverend Lovejoy! You\\'ve... you\\'ve come to comfort me? Did you kill my principal? No! My principal! What\\'s that guy doing here? Hey! Get bent. Sorry Fat Tony. I used to think your gang was cool, but now I learned that crime doesn\\'t pay. Cool! \"To me bestest bud Milhouse, Happy Birthday, Bart.\" C\\'mon, open it open it open it. Aw Milhouse, just cuz your mom didn\\'t let you have a party doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t get a present. What are you girls talkin\\' about? Twins. Open your present. They\\'re official Krusty the Clown walkie-talkies. I\\'ll keep one and you keep one. Now whenever you want to talk to me, just call me on the phone and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie. What\\'s he talkin\\' about? Wow, brown! You did have a party. You didn\\'t invite me. And I thought we were best friends. My best friend shafted me. I\\'ll never get over this, Otto-man. Milhouse, a little salt? What\\'s she got against me? Bad influence my ass! How many times have I told you, never listen to your mother! Whatever she\\'s paying you, I\\'ll double it. Nah. I\\'m just depressed. Milhouse\\'s mom won\\'t let me play with him any more. I had a fight with Milhouse. One... two... three... Community chest. Nah. Nah. Ah. I\\'ve won second prize in a beauty contest. Collect ten bucks. Ha ha! You\\'re losing. Don\\'t worry mom, there\\'s tons of these things. I don\\'t wanna play with Milhouse. It\\'s his mom. She says I\\'m a bad influence. C\\'mon Maggie, let\\'s go throw rocks at that hornet\\'s nest. Who cares?! Milhouse, I\\'ll be right there! Sorry Maggie, game\\'s over. Hey Mom, I\\'m friends with Milhouse again. Who else would? I will. Yes, sir? Okay Milhouse, how many Krusty autographs should I put you down for? Consider it done. YOU\\'RE WALKING ALONG THE STREET/ OR YOU\\'RE AT A PARTY/ OR ELSE YOU\\'RE ALONE/ AND THEN YOU SUDDENLY DIG... DIG... DIG. THIS COULD BE THE START OF SOMETHING BIG... Aw, man. Dear Krusty, this is Bart Simpson, Krusty Buddy #16302 respectfully returning his Badge... ...I always suspected that nothing in life mattered. Now I know for sure. Get bent, Bart Simpson. Why bother, they\\'ll just get dirty again. He is, for sure? God bless that clown. Milhouse. You can come in and drop the charade. Krusty, you don\\'t have to be \"on\" tonight. Yeah, just relax and be yourself. Krusty, would you do the honors? Krusty, are you alright? Yeah, spill your guts, man. Don\\'t worry, I don\\'t even like using the bathroom after you. Krusty, do you think about your father a lot? Yeah, I\\'ve got a lot of fond memories. Goodnight, Krusty. Sorry about your dad. No! Oh great, we came all this way and it\\'s the wrong guy. Poor Krusty. We\\'ve got to do something. Reverend Lovejoy, we need you to help us find a rabbi. Really? Oh, oh, that radio show. We\\'ll put them on later. Now can you give us the rabbi\\'s address? He\\'ll be so happy, he\\'ll be crying in his beard. We came to talk to you about your son. Hello, my name\\'s Dimitri. I\\'m a first time caller, long time listener. My question is, \"If a son defies his father, and chooses a career that makes millions of children happy, shouldn\\'t the father forgive the son?\" Don\\'t worry, Lis. I\\'ve got a plan that can\\'t fail. Yiddle my man, you\\'re a genius. Speaking of charity, Rabbi Krustofsky, don\\'t you think it\\'s time you forgave your son? Oy, this guy\\'s tough. I don\\'t know, he\\'s pretty sharp. He saw right through this disguise. Au revoir. Sorry, no. Just get us another bowl of complimentary pickles. Those stupid hats? Ahhh, Noah, Noah, save us, save us... No!! But... but... but, but Rabbi, does it not say in the Babylonian Talmud... And I quote, \"A child should be pushed aside with the left hand, and drawn closer with the right.\" Then doesn\\'t your religion command you to make up with Krusty? Oh, it\\'s hopeless. At all times let a man be supple as a reed and not rigid as a cedar. Is it not written in the Talmud, \"Who will bring redemption? The jesters.\" Rabbi, did not a great man say, and I quote, \"The Jews are a swinging bunch of people. I mean, I\\'ve heard of persecution, but what they went through is ridiculous! But the great thing is after thousands of years of waiting and holding on and fighting, they finally made it.\" End quote. Nope. Nope. Nope. I\\'m afraid not, Rabbi. It\\'s from \"Yes, I Can\" by Sammy Davis Jr. An entertainer like your son. Heh heh heh...Jackpot! We would have gotten even more if Lisa could walk faster. Oh, yeah. Everybody in the family is gonna have a bad nightmare tonight. I can do that but I don\\'t wanna. Let\\'s wish for x-ray specs that really work. X-ray specs. X-ray specs. X-ray specs. X-ray spects. Okay, no more fooling around. Paw, this is Bart. I wish for the Simpsons to be rich and famous. Jeez, now we\\'re slaves. This paw sucks. Huh?... S\\'matter? No. Climb aboard. Less talk, more sleep. Good morning. Every day, same old cat. I\\'ll make him more interesting. Oh, there. That\\'s better. Okay. Hi guys. Hi Otto. Move over. I\\'m driving. Quit riding the brake, Otto. Give it some gas, man. Phone. I love school. I want to watch Krusty. Do I ever! Good night, dad. You know, these last few days have been really swell. I wish there was something I could do to repay you. You got it. I love you, dad. Yaahhh! We both had nightmares. Hey, Dad. Here\\'s one. Twenty-eight dollars an hour, plenty of fresh air... and you get to meet lots of interesting people. Grave digger. Dad\\'s missing? Get outta here. Hey, man, you were crushing me. I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab. I\\'d like to open with my impression of Principal Skinner. Duh, look at me, I\\'m Principal Skinner. Hey, it\\'s Lunchlady Doris. I wonder what she\\'s got for us today. Today\\'s special is refried dog poop. Hey, how come Lisa gets a pony? I don\\'t love you either. So give me a moped. Grampa, if you wanna go right... ... move your joystick to the left. Uh-oh, here comes a Xylon cruiser. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go into hyperspace! Ready, hit it! Grampa, you\\'re the spaceship, not the... Game\\'s over, Grampa. Busted! Oh my God, she killed him. Well, it\\'s still fun to be up late. Hey, Homer, where ya goin\\'? The poor guy. Where\\'s he working? I can make her. Just give me five minutes alone with her. Hey, pink hat, when I ordered that blueberry squishee, I meant today. And fill it to the top this time. Hey, Dad, you got a power drill? Check. Hey, Homer, I can\\'t find the safety goggles for the power saw. Oh, check. What? No, not really. Building a Soap Box Derby racer. Hey, so it is. Well, as three-time soapbox derby champ Ronnie Beck says, \"Poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine.\" Oh, yeah? Are you building a racer, Martin? Maybe it\\'s for the best. Thanks, but I\\'m almost done. Why don\\'t you get back on the couch and watch TV? Sorry dad, but three time Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dad\\'s help. Come on Dad, it\\'d be weird. Ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes. Helmets are for wusses, Sir. Aye carumba! It\\'s over there, Nelson. What was that? Don\\'t worry, Dad, as three time Soap Box derby champion Ronnie Beck says, \"Gravity is my co-pilot.\" Is it okay to visit? Hey man, cool crash. Way to cheat death. You had the best stick out there, man. I wish I could build \\'em like you. If you don\\'t race, then Nelson\\'ll win! Oh, I don\\'t know if I should do that. My dad and I built our car together and if I drove someone else\\'s it\\'d kill him. On the other hand... I\\'ll do it. Dad... I don\\'t know how to say this, but I don\\'t want to drive your car. It\\'s slow, it\\'s ugly, it handles like a shopping cart... Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win. Well, I picked it up somewhere. And if I drive Martin\\'s car I can win. I\\'m sorry, but... Dad, aren\\'t you coming? Dad, you gotta come. I just got your hat out of the fridge. Kill spectators. It\\'s my dad. Lying there on the couch drinking a beer, staring at the TV. I\\'ve never seen him like that. Let\\'s rock. Thanks, Mr. Beck. I was alone out there, but someone was riding with me in spirit... This is for you, Dad. Thanks, Nelson, put her there. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Loser! Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah! Mom, I never won before. I may never win again. Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah! Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Whoa, T and A. Lisa\\'s slumber party. Who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me? What the... ? Aaahhh! Ptew!! Ptew!! I\\'m telling Mom and Dad. Because I\\'m \"jinxed\" dammit! Ow! What was that for? Aye carumba! \"The Inventor I Admire\", by Bart Simpson. The inventor I admire is, not a rich man, or a famous man, or even a smart man. He\\'s my father, Homer Simpson, creator of... the \"Flaming Homer\"! It\\'s not true! My father invented that drink, and if you\\'ll allow me to demonstrate... I brought enough for everybody. Okay. Uh, yes, I\\'m looking for a friend of mine. Last name Jass, first name Hugh. Uh... hi. Bart Simpson. Uh, look. I\\'ll level with you, mister. This is a crank call that sorta backfired and I\\'d like to bail out right now. Okay, but you promised me moe money.',\n",

Scourge Of The Despot. \"O Tyrant Hear His Mighty Name And QUAKE!!\" Smithers, I\\'m back! Oh, top o\\' the mornin\\' to ye! Why, look who\\'s here! It\\'s good old... you! Oh, hey, there, Mr... Brown Shoes! How about that local sports team? Hm? Heh-heh-heh! Well, that\\'s game! Hasta manana, Osvaldo! Smithers, I\\'m back in the pink! Full of pith and vinegar! You know, it\\'s funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and tonic and patent medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. By the way, what was the lad\\'s name? Who? Well, the Simpsons will be getting a very nice surprise in the mail. Very nice, indeed. I want the whole world to hear the story of my harrowing struggle with hypohemia. Excellent. Well, Countess Van Zeplin and I... What in blaze... Now you listen to me, you bargain basement Baudelaire. I\\'m not some dizzy starlet who can\\'t string two words together. I can write this thing myself. You\\'re fired. \"Chapter the Fifth... A Trip to the Infirmary, With Most Unexpected Results.\" Can I help you? Oh, don\\'t be frightened of this. It\\'s nothing but a letter opener. Who are you?

I\\'ll just crush him like an ant. \"Senile,\" eh? \"Buck-toothed,\" am I? \"Bony arms,\" are they? \"Liver spots,\" did I? \"Chinless,\" will you? Now, that\\'s odd. I\\'ve just robbed a man of his livelihood, and yet I feel strangely empty. Tell you what, Smithers. Have him beaten to a pulp. But what? In closing, gentle reader, I\\'d like to thank you. What\\'s that you say? Me thanking you? No, it\\'s not a misprint. For you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much as you enjoyed reading it. The end. Ah Smithers, how\\'d the beating go? What? Well that\\'s a hell of a thing! Why? Judas! I see. No need, Smithers. As usual, you\\'ve been the sober \"ying\" to my raging \"yang.\" Put \\'er there, old pal. We do indeed, old friend. We do indeed. We\\'ll get the Simpsons a present, an extravagant present! A mad, unthinkable, utterly impossible present! A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present! Ooo, too practical. Too cutesy-poo. Too cornball. A pool table? Are you mad? I\\'m not gonna turn his home into a saloon. Eureka! We\\'ve found it! Don\\'t you dare sully this moment with your price taggery! It\\'s perfect! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Why, what did you think I was going to do -- have you beaten to a bloody pulp? To show there\\'s no hard feelings, please take an advance copy of my book, \"Will There Ever Be A Rainbow?\" And now, young fellow, I haven\\'t forgotten you. Here. Actually, son, it\\'s a big, ugly Olmec Indian head. It was carved by Meso-American Indians over 3,000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xt\\'tapalatakettle, the god of war. Well, I\\'ll let you get acquainted with SeÃ±or Xt\\'tapalatakettle. Ta! Did you see their faces, Smithers? Wait a minute, go back. Zoom in. Why is that man in pink? Simpson, eh? Well, judging by his outlandish attire, he\\'s some sort of free-thinking anarchist. Excellent. These color monitors have already paid for themselves. Spare me the tired semantics of the Simpson family! Take him away! Or perhaps you two are in cahoots. Smithers, I seem to recall you had a penchant for bell-bottom trousers back in \\'79. Oh, yes, of course. Your spirited hornpipe stole the show, as I recall. Now Doctor, what shall we do about our free wheeling fop over here? No. Who is that bookworm, Smithers? Simpson, eh? How very strange. His job description clearly specifies an illiterate. Ah! Look, Smithers, another member of our nuclear family, with some helpful suggestions. And what\\'s your name? Simpson, eh? Hmm hmmm. I\\'m Monty Burns. Hm. \"Keep that handsome owner out of sight. He\\'s distracting the female employees.\" Smithers... Oh! It\\'s a real one! \"No more apples in the vending machine, please.\" Well, that\\'s almost a sentence! Oh, of course. And don\\'t worry, there\\'ll be plenty of apples for you. Nobody will take away your precious apples. Now, now, now. Tell my secretary I said you could have a free apple. She\\'ll make everything all right, I promise. Damned infernal gizmo. My kingdom for a left-handed can opener! Smithers, I\\'m licked. You open this can. Hold it, Smithers! I\\'ll open the can! To the mall! I\\'ll explain on the way! The world has turned has it not my tin-plated friend? Look at you -- you, who were once so proud -- Feel the wrath of the left hand of Burns! The boys at the Diners Club will think I\\'ve gone quite mad. Oh, and I\\'ll have that roadster in the corner as well. Huzzah for the shopkeep! Thank God we live in a country so hysterical over crime that a ten-year-old child can be tried as an adult. Ah, Monday morning. Time to pay for your two days of debauchery, you hung-over drones. Yeah. so, what did you do this weekend, Smithers? Who the devil is Hercules? Well, Smithers, don\\'t you know how to paint the town red. Well, a bit overly familiar, but I\\'ll allow it. I took in a movie. An appalling little piece of filth. Its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the film strolling around naked as a jaybird. Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they\\'ll \\'oink\\' for more every time. Call me old-fashioned, but movies were sexier when the actors kept their clothes on. Vilma Banky could do more for me with one raised eyebrow than an entire... 7-G? Good God, who\\'s the safety inspector there? Simpson, eh? Good man? Intelligent? Thank you, President Ford. Oh hello, Kent. Right now, skilled nuclear energy technicians are calmly correcting a minor, piffling malfunction. But, I can assure you and the public that there is absolutely no danger whatsoever -- -- things couldn\\'t be more ship-shape. How the hell should I know? Oh, meltdown is one of those annoying buzzwords. I prefer to call it an unrequested fission surplus. Oh, hot dog. Thank you for making my last few moments on earth socially awkward. Oh, Smithers, I guess there\\'s nothing left but to kiss my sorry butt good-bye! Yes, we\\'ve isolated the problem and wouldn\\'t you know? False alarm. It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system. Excellent. Well, \"ta\". Hmmm, Smithers, I can still sell \\'em snake oil. Now bring me a wine spritzer -- and don\\'t be stingy with the vino. So, Smithers, it seems you\\'ve underestimated one Homer Simpson... our next Employee-of-the-Month. Smithers, you bean counter, give it up! Simpson\\'s my man! Simpson -- Monty Burns. Come with me. Now, now. That will do. Homer, for your bravery and skill, we award you this ham, this plaque, this discount coupon book, and my own personal thumbs up! And to insure your immortality, your heroic visage will be added to our Wall of Fame... Oh, and uh, what\\'s this? A congratulatory phone call from Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson. Ah Simpson! There\\'s someone I want you to meet. Aristotle Amadopolis, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power facility. It seems Ari\\'s been having terrible worker problems at Shelbyville. We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of Homer Simpsons. Oh cut the false modesty, it\\'s getting tiresome. Besides, it\\'s your duty. Employee of the Month isn\\'t all ham and plaques. Well! Smithers, how kind of you to pay us a visit. Begone from my sight. That one\\'s always been a problem. Look at them, Smithers. Goldbrickers, lay-abouts, slug-a-beds... Little do they realize their days of suckling at my teat are numbered. Very well. Eeney, meany, miney... ugh, him. Smithers, to the laboratory. You know Smithers, I\\'ve always despised the laziness of the common worker. Then I realized his spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak. So I replaced the flesh -- which is weak -- with steel, which is strong. Behold, the greatest breakthrough in labor relations since the cat o\\' nine tails. Keep your pants on, Smithers. First, we need... The human brain. I don\\'t know. I feel like a kid in a candy store. Hello! An open grave. Smithers, get him out quickly, the stench is overpowering. Oh, will you quit your complaining. Well, who is a model ... employee? No, I didn\\'t. Who is it? Frankenstein? The Booger Man? Oh... bad corpse. Bad corpse. Stop scaring Smithers. Satisfied? Excellent. Smithers, hand me that ice cream scoop. Damn it, Smithers. This isn\\'t rocket science, it\\'s brain surgery. Hel-lo. Look at me, I\\'m Davey Crockett. Look, Smithers, a twitch... it\\'s moving. It\\'s alive! Oh, that fellow at Radio Shack said I was mad... well who\\'s mad now?! Hi there. I\\'m your dad-dy. It wasn\\'t suppose to be this way. It was supposed to be a thing of beauty, not this abomination. Oh Smithers, I was wrong to play god. Life is precious, not a thing to be toyed with. Now, take out that brain and flush it down the toilet. Oh, come on. It\\'s 11:45. Oh, Smithers, when you look at me with those puppy dog eyes... all right. Oh you\\'re right, Smithers.

I guess I\\'ll go and stretch my legs. Catfish Lake. Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who\\'s General Sherman? Oh yeah. Whoa, who says that? Oh. Hmmmm. Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman! None of your business, Flanders. Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing? Oh. I see. I also understand bowling expressions. Lucky you don\\'t keep guns in the house. Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress. She\\'s perfect. Well, sometimes that can be annoying. I\\'m done. It\\'s true. It\\'s all true. Sorry. I only did that a couple of times. Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence. . The perfect crime. Would this be a good time to be honest? You\\'re right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy? No. All right. But I can\\'t sleep. Can I take a walk? Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband. Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA! Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. I gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it. Good! Give up! Huh? Okay, fish, you\\'re probably wondering why I\\'m still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show. Whoa! Holy mackerel! I love you, but I must kill you. I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD! Uh, oh. Hi, honey. Uh, oh. How\\'s the marriage retreat going? Marge, you don\\'t know what this fish means. This fish represents a better life for both of us. This fish makes me a champion and a hero. To those weirdos in the worm store. Well, if that\\'s the way you feel... I\\'ll throw it back. Watch. Wow, I did it! I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. She says one word and I toss it back. And you\\'re telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby. We\\'re back! Same as usual. Perfectomundo. I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time. I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat! All right, what are you getting at? A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo? Well, t.s. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No! Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I\\'m not mad at you for trying. It shows you\\'ve been paying attention. But we all know I\\'m not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me? Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you? Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo! Bart! What are you staring at? Bart! Stop it! Hey, what\\'s all the -- My beer... my beer... my beautiful beer. What\\'s the problem, boy? Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money. Nah. Son, I\\'m proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out. They\\'re fine. Joke\\'s on them. If the core explodes, there won\\'t be any power to light that sign. How many hairs on my head? Without looking! I can\\'t believe you guys. There\\'s a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don\\'t wanna cash in? That\\'s why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job. Sorry, sir. Marge! Marge! What\\'s my blood type? Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don\\'t have it. Earmuffs. Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn\\'t get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it. Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You\\'ve got a date with a needle! Yeah, you have the right to remain silent. Bart, it\\'s not like I\\'m asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! You\\'re a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man\\'s life, he showers you with riches. Don\\'t you know the story of Hercules and the Lion? Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches. It was the olden days! Hey, let\\'s go! Emergency! Life-or-death here! Now let\\'s get the show on the road. Eh.... the boy. Mr. Burns... he\\'s okay! Jackpot! Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo! Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let\\'s do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see! Lisa, dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something! It\\'s a little thin, but that\\'s okay, could be a check. \"Better half,\" Marge. \"Better half.\" All right, there\\'s no check, just a card. But don\\'t panic. I\\'m sure it tells us what we\\'re getting and where we can pick it up. \"Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns.\" It\\'s just a card! This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. That\\'s what got me so mad in the first place. Marge, you\\'re my wife and I love you very much. But you\\'re living in a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats... Bart! I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I\\'ve had it! Bart, take a letter. \"Dear Mr. Burns. I\\'m so glaaad you enjoyed my son\\'s blood. And your caard was just great. In case you can\\'t tell, I\\'m being sarcastic. You stink!\" Could you read that last part back to me? Good. \"You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like...\" An elephant\\'s butt. Yup! Forget it, Marge! Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing! And it usually works. Cheap son-of-a... Hmmm... Oh, Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. Y\\'know, I finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph. Where\\'s the letter? Where is it? Well, it\\'s somewhere! It didn\\'t just get up and walk away! Bart, have you seen the letter? All right, think very carefully. Where did you see it last? Uh huh. Yeah... Why did you do that? I\\'ll show you mad in the morning. She\\'s right. Okay, think, Homer. Don\\'t panic. They don\\'t pick up the mail till noon. There\\'s still time! Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy. What does it look like? I\\'ll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it. So a few people won\\'t get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: \"Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo.\" Big loss. Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal. That\\'s a good one. We\\'ll use that. Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn\\'t do any good to run, \\'cause you\\'re our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh? Well, I\\'m still gonna run! I don\\'t know. Great plan, Bart. Lisa, I don\\'t know what you\\'re doing, but it\\'s very strange and your father is trying to worry. Oops. Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take. Homer Simpson. Yeah, well I\\'ll be on my -- Hey, c\\'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm? Oh, I\\'ve never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he\\'s always kinda mad. Me and my big... letter writing pen! Okay, here\\'s the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I\\'ll... die in a gutter. It\\'s practical and within our means. I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one. Oh, woe is me. Mr. Burns, you brought us a present. What did I tell you? I\\'ll bet it\\'s filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls... Marge, what does it do? Marge! Really, what does it do? Save a guy\\'s life, and whattaya get? Nothin\\'! Worse than nothin\\'! Just a big, scary rock. Wait a minute. If I hadn\\'t written that nasty letter, we wouldn\\'t have gotten anything! Exactly. It\\'s just a bunch of stuff that happened. Amen to that! Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt? Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink? Marge, I can\\'t wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I\\'m not popular enough to be different. Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It\\'s all over, Marge. It\\'s all over. You! You did this to me! Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I\\'m wearing a pink shirt, it doesn\\'t mean I\\'m some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting -- You don\\'t understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry... Print name? Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form. All right, all right. I\\'ll get Lisa to do it. Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me? O-kay. No deal. Son, it\\'s no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot? Look at him! Awww. Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire! Yes, I\\'m hearing one right now, while I\\'m trying to watch TV. Bart! Shut up or I\\'ll shut you up! So, did I pass? The devil with his fly open. That\\'s a spill on a floor with bugs goin\\' after it. They\\'re gonna eat it. Arrghh! The boy! This isn\\'t fair! How can you tell who\\'s sane and who\\'s insane? Who are you? I\\'m Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons. Oh, of course I\\'ve heard of you. I mean you\\'d have to be living under a rock not to know -- what\\'d you say your name was? Doesn\\'t ring a bell. What was that last one? Nope. Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet? No, that thing with your feet. Because I wore a pink shirt. What\\'d you wear? Bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl-- Hey, Michael, I don\\'t get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me. Okay. Five times nine. Wowww. Hey, Chief. Gee, I gotta call my family. Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling \\'em from a nut house. I mean, they think I\\'m a god. Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight. That\\'s all right, son. What\\'s that? This place is so strange. Mike, I\\'m ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I\\'m... scared. Pancakes... football... Boobies... Was the door locked? Was it raining? Were you out of gas? Baby. Mmm... pancakes. Marge! That\\'s the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please? Not insane. Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us. You are? Why? Boy, when I get home, I\\'m going to wrap my hands around your neck -- Now listen. I\\'m bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn\\'t that cute -- he\\'s heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice. Are you sure you\\'re here voluntarily? Thanks everybody! It\\'s great to be sane. Here he is! Here\\'s the guy you wanna see. Huh? Huh? Come off. I\\'m sane now. Not me. I got this. Stupid junk mail... \"You May Have Already Won!\" Yeah, win this... \"Here\\'s Good News for Homer Simpsoy\"... I\\'ll see that he gets it. How dumb do they think I am? Huh? A check? Oh yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure? Shut up. I had a feeling it was too good to be true. Every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal. Marge, I never read a magazine in my life and I\\'m not gonna start now. Hey, a cartoon. \"Well dear, you always wanted a compact.\" -- Ain\\'t it the truth. Oh, Marge. Cartoons don\\'t have any deep meaning. They\\'re just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh. Nah, you go ahead. As Tolstoy said in \"Quotable Notables,\" \"Give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread.\" Marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds. Ooh... How about the \"V\"? It\\'s not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket. Those kids don\\'t know what they\\'re missing. We\\'re all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival. Then I heard the sound that all Arctic explorers dread: The pitiless bark of the sea lion. He\\'ll be killed! Don\\'t be so... Oh, you\\'re right. Hmph? That reminds me! \"Seven Ways To Spice Up Your Marriage.\" Marge, you have a nice body. And if you\\'d like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask. Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong. And it was free. Free! Wow! \"Win a Trip to Washington D.C.\"! \"All expenses paid... VIP tour\"... Oh. It\\'s for kids. Ooh... And Miss? Just one more question -- Sweetheart, there\\'s nothing I wouldn\\'t do for that magazine. YEAH! Damn right! Uh-uh. Woo hoo! Who would\\'ve guessed reading and writing would pay off? Playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot\\'s wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else I\\'ve got coming to me. We\\'re all gonna die! Look, Marge, that guy has the same last name we do... Taxi! BOOOOO! Wowww -- A shoehorn! Just like in the movies! Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Stupid welcoming mint! Y\\'ello. Wake-up call? It\\'s two AM! Free food?! Ooh! I love your magazine. My favorite section is \"How To Increase Your Word Power.\" That thing is really, really, really good. Miss? What does the \"I\" stand for? Ah! What does the \"I\" stand for again? Yeah, right. Mmmmmm... Money. Lousy cheap country... BART! Get out of the Spirit of St. Louis! Hey, what\\'s so funny? Oh Marge, grow up. Who\\'s that? Bart, are you ready to go to... I\\'ll room service you... Yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin\\'. Gimme one of those! Give her the check! I was serious. I\\'m almost done. I\\'ll be there. Not-y not-y not. Well, why doesn\\'t he just say so? Oh, here we go again. Look, I don\\'t care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he\\'s a jerk. End of story. Excuse me? Better? Thanks a lot, Marge, you really put me in my place. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. Marge Simpson... President of the International We Love Flanders Fan Club... Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead, Marge, have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They\\'d cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders\\'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders\\' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I\\'d be laughing. Laughing from my grave. What is it, boy? What? Mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que. Hey, everyone, I\\'m back! Great to see ya! Nice seein\\' ya! Hey, no tagbacks. The fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake... That was a joke? Uh... Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me. Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz? Nah. No, it isn\\'t. Hmm, let\\'s see. Nah. Hmmm. Heyyyy. Keep your pants on, Flanders! I\\'m wishing as fast as I can! Ooooh. Mmmm -- too far. Okay. Ready. Yesssss! Oh yessss! Read it and weep. In your face. I\\'ve got more chicken bone! Oooh. That would be a shame. Wouldn\\'t it, Flanders? Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It\\'s a boy\\'s best friend. See, Marge? You knock TV and then it helps you out. I think you owe somebody a little apology. Well, if it isn\\'t the Leftorium. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Hey Flanders, how\\'s business? So, Flanders, have you sold anything? I\\'m telling you, Flanders\\' store was dee-serted. So what do you think of your bestest buddy now, Marge? No, I do not know what Schadenfreude is. Please tell me, because I\\'m dying to know. Oh, come on, Lisa. I\\'m just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. He\\'s usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... What\\'s the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours? Boy, those Germans have a word for everything. Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks. Ooh, the touch of death. Hey, boy. How was class? Oh, that\\'ll learn \\'im. Hey Flanders, when are your busy hours? Lousy. He just sits there all day. He\\'d have a great job if he didn\\'t own the place. Uh, well actually, Moe... Apple, apple, apple... Come on candy bar. Hey, I know you! You\\'re that first apple I didn\\'t want. That sinks it. I\\'m really gonna let \\'em have it this time! Homer Simpson, sir. Can I leave, Mr. Burns? But the note was asking you to -- Um, Mr. Burns... Sorry, Flanders. Huh? Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay? Oh, I get it. It\\'s not good enough for you, but it\\'s good enough for me! Well, I wouldn\\'t be caught dead buying this... Hello! I\\'ll give you twenty bucks for it. You were swindled, my friend. Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it. Sorry! No cash for Neddie! Homer keep all money! Bye bye Neddie! Bye bye! Twenty dollars? Now I don\\'t want it. I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest. Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney? Daddly-doodly. Only seventy-five beans! Oh, I know I need to pay them. But there\\'s just so many. I know, but... Wait a minute. I\\'m Homer Simpson. Ned Flanders lives over there. Flanders is in debt? Are you sure? Uh, there\\'s a store where... Yeah. Knock \\'em dead, boy! Kid\\'s gonna be a black belt in no time. Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back. You\\'re gonna live in your car? I know! Why not? Oh. Oh, it\\'s all my fault. Yes it is. No, I was a swine. Listen, Flanders, do you still have that store? Flanders, you open that store tomorrow! I SAID DO IT! Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson. Remember last month, when I paid back that loan? Well, now I need you to do a favor for me. C\\'mon, you lefties. What\\'d I tell you? It\\'s all here, and it\\'s all backwards. That\\'s right. To Ned Flanders... the richest left- handed man in town. Hey, look what I got. A genuine official police badge... Calling all cars... come out with your hands up! That\\'s Officer Homer. Heh heh, heh, heh. How much does it pay? Pfft. I make more than that. ... Bart! Have you started smoking? Don\\'t lie to me boy. Aha! Cigarettes, just as I thought. Yeah, right. Son... I\\'m gonna teach you a lesson. I\\'m going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you\\'ll learn... Son, I\\'ll never doubt you again. A job\\'s a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal. See? It was all your imagination. Oh, all right. Hee hee, hee-hee-hee! Read \\'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes. You know if you need a hat check girl, I\\'ve got a daughter. Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding. Kill my boy! Kill my boy! Wait till I get you home, boy. Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it\\'s true, it\\'s true! All the pieces fit. I thought he was dead. Eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple. Hey, when do we get the check for this? You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers. Here\\'s good news. According to this eye-catching article, SAT scores are declining at a slower rate. Hey, this is the only paper in America that\\'s not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine. What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets. Huh? Noise. Bad noise! Critical wha...? Okay, okay, don\\'t panic. Whosever problem this is, I\\'m sure they know how to handle it. Huh? AHHH!! It\\'s my problem! We\\'re doomed!!! Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there\\'s a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT. Who\\'d have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated! I don\\'t understand anything! When they look up stupid in the dictionary, there\\'ll be a picture of me! Shut up! Simpson, it\\'s all up to you. It\\'s showtime! Okay, okay, think back to your training... Yes. Ooh, a side. What? Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it. This is all your fault! Okay, gotta pick a button. Pick a button. Pick a button. Uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... No, wait! Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? No, no! Eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... Eenie meenie minee... Moe. Hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor\\'s a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right button. Magic Johnson! Y\\'ello. Yeah. Well, thank you. Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy\\'s a hero but he was really just lucky? Thanks, Magic. Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I don\\'t need it here at home. It tastes so bitter. It\\'s like ashes in my mouth! What\\'s your problem, boy? That four-eyes with the big nose? You don\\'t need friends like that. What? What is it? What are you doing? Well, as long as it\\'s quiet. Oooh, right next to the boss. Eh, he\\'ll never know who did it. Huh? Wha?... Their Eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what? But I really can\\'t tell them anything, sir. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? Did it work? Uh... ladies and... gentlemen... Um, Grace under pressure is no... Whew! Saved by the bell. All right. Eeenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe... If he hollers let him go, eenie meenie minee moe. Sure. Moe. You think it\\'s him? What are you talking about? Of course he does. We could have seen a monkey. He\\'s talking funny talk. A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here. Mel Brooks is Jewish? Hey Krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what? Yeah, Krusty, tell us. Boy, you don\\'t have to follow in my footsteps. Why you little... No, that\\'s it. You\\'ve seen everything. Gladly. Hey, if you don\\'t like it, go to Russia. Hey, aren\\'t you a little old for this? You\\'re not even wearing costumes. Here you go, kids. Lousy punks... Get a good haul this year? I am very, very proud of you kids. I\\'d like to see that. What a dump. Why would Princess Grace live in a place like this? Eeuhgh. What is this thing? Oh yeah? How much? C\\'mom pal, I don\\'t wanna hear your life story. Paw me! Why at that little shop, right over... there. Oh no, wait, it was over there. Don\\'t shoot, Don\\'t shoot. They\\'re souvenirs. Okay. Forget it, you two. As the pants- wearer of this house, I get the first wish. Marge, don\\'t flake out on me. That monkey\\'s paw is gonna make our dreams come true. Ooh, a luxury car. Good baby. Good Maggie. Now you\\'re talkin\\'! Woo hoo! C\\'mon, everybody. We\\'re going to the fanciest restaurant in town! Come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. I thought he was just being colorful. Lisa, that was very selfish of you. Ok, Ok. I\\'ll make a wish that can\\'t backfire. I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, And...AND! I don\\'t want any zombie turkeys, I don\\'t want to turn into a turkey myself, and I don\\'t want any other weird surprises. You got it? Hey... Hmm. Not bad. Nice hot mustard... good bread... Turkey\\'s a little dry. The turkey\\'s a little dry?! Oh foul, accursed thing! What demon from the depths of hell created thee?! Yeah, but I gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... Yeah, that\\'s what it is. Wanna try it? Heh, heh, heh. I wish I had a Monkey\\'s Paw. Hiya Bart!!! How\\'s my boy! Heh heh. Heh heh. It\\'s good that you made that awful thing, Bart. It\\'s real good. He gets it from your side of the family, you know. No monsters on my side. Come on... make it... make it... make it... please... please... please. Shut up boy. If they make this field goal I win fifty bucks. Slowly... slowly... don\\'t make a sound... don\\'t even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he\\'s least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. End of monster. Heh heh heh. I\\'m not nodding. It\\'s the air conditioning. Ouch! Good night, son. Well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back. Oh, ah, thanks boy. I love you, son. You both toilet-trained? Well, okay then... ... Four o\\'clock... Coupla hours I have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work. Huh? What? For what? How do you know I was sleeping? Camera? How hard can it be? Ooo, what job is that? Sheesh. What a slave driver. No. Bart bit me. I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly. I didn\\'t wake up. It\\'s all a dream. It\\'s just a dream! Umm. Spaghetti. Oh, I hate having two heads. Y\\'ello. Don\\'t worry, I know it\\'s tonight. Uh... isn\\'t this the kind of thing your mother\\'s better at? Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed. Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer? Hurry, Moe, hurry! I\\'ve only got five minutes till the music store closes. Hey, do I tell you how to do your job? You know, if you tip the glass, there won\\'t be so much foam on top. Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare. The moron next door closed early! Oh, me and my trenchant mouth. Hmm. \"Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!\" Yes! That\\'s it! Please, you\\'ve got to open that store. Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you\\'re disappointing. Well I don\\'t have one. I\\'ll have you know, I wrote it down. Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum! Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo! I dunno. No. No. No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one again? Whew, I\\'d hate to be that kid\\'s father. Uh-oh. Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah! I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh. That cost eighty-eight dollars! Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that doesn\\'t make it right, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. You didn\\'t mean that! No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed that she was alive. Okay. Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie. Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I\\'m gonna -- you know -- go fruity. No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let\\'s see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I\\'ll buy her that pony she\\'s always bugging me for. Marge, with today\\'s gasoline prices, we can\\'t afford not to buy a pony. Marge, I\\'ve got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa\\'s eyes, I don\\'t see love anymore. See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes. Ha ha, you love me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm. Buh. Sneh. Excuse me, do you sell ponies? \"Scot-tish deer-hound.\" Hey, this is a dog! Now lady, I\\'m buying this pony for my little girl, and I don\\'t care what it costs. Half a million dollars?! Wow! I\\'ll take it! Uh, sure... let me write you a check. Is there a problem with that? Isn\\'t there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home? I-I\\'d like to borrow five thousand dollars. Mr. Burns, you do this personally? U-su-ry? I want to buy a pony. No. I need to get it for my little girl because she doesn\\'t love me any more. Sorry. Of course. Simpson, you\\'ve done it again. Sounds like someone\\'s angling for a pony of her own. Because she stopped loving me. I know you love me. So you don\\'t get squat. Hee hee hee hee. I\\'ve got it all figured out. By day it will roam free around the neighborhood. And at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage. That\\'s for the courts to decide. Marge, she loves me. Stable? That sounds expensive. This is what love costs a month? Oh nuts. I was hoping it\\'d be money. Well you know, we\\'re always buying Maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn\\'t even have. Nah, we\\'re not gonna be doing that. First you didn\\'t want me to get the pony. Now, you want me to take it back. Make up your mind. Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays. Fine, I will. There\\'s plenty of money out there for a guy who\\'s willing to work for it. Do you have any jewelry you don\\'t need anymore? Need money. Need money. One Scratch-for-Cash, please. Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, come on, come on... Oh. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Three Liberty Bells! That\\'ll be TEN thousand dollars, Apu. Thank you. There it is. No. No! No! No! You can\\'t see... come on! No! Let go. You\\'re ripping it. Ohh... I need money. You\\'re looking for help? I\\'m your man! Woo-hoo! ...Badge of honor. But I eat... Oh. Heh heh, the perfect crime. Marge, could we go in the other room? I did something last night I\\'m not proud of and I don\\'t want the kids to hear it. I\\'ll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to spend as I please. Then I\\'m off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy. Mmm... salty. No sir. Yes sir. I don\\'t know. How long do horses live? Mustn\\'t sleep. Must monitor core. Y\\'ello. Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me? Going for... eight hour walk. Homer sleep now. Coming right up, sir. Yes, sir. Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money... You did? Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus! Awww. Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it! That baby changed our lives. Oooooh! That\\'s one clean tombstone. In the garage. Yeah, give us a break, Doctor. If stuff starts flying, just turn your head. Okay, okay, calm down. Okay, I will. I will. Patty, Selma, what a pleasant surprise. ... Expiration date: June, 1999... Uh, 2012, yeah. Shh! They\\'ll hear you. I don\\'t know. Some guy I guess. How much? What\\'s the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you? Anything for my little girl. Bart! You can\\'t weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid. Ooooooh, McBain. Why? I just saw the best part. Just grab something. All these movies are great. Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman. Oh Marge. Uh, let\\'s see, Bart\\'s friends... Well, there\\'s the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who\\'s always got his hands in his pockets. Okay. Hank. Hank... Jones. Steve McQueen. Next. Well, he\\'s always chewing on that phone cord. Then he has no hobbies. Bart!... BART!!! You don\\'t have any hobbies, do you boy? Well, that\\'s what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing? Oh, that\\'s a hobby! Oh, my God. I don\\'t know jack about my boy... I\\'m a bad father! I\\'m also fat! I\\'m Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero. Goodbye, son. Ho, ho... if he\\'s as smart as he is funny, I\\'m sold. Well, that\\'s easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son? Huh? Oh, how I envy you! I\\'ve never been afraid of a little hard work. What boy? Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer. Bart!... I\\'m gonna help you build that racer. Okay. No, I\\'m gonna do it. But you can use me. I\\'m good. I\\'ve built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree. What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you. Oh this isn\\'t working at all. It\\'s hopeless... Wait a second. Hmm... \"Cosby\\'s first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite.\" Huh? Oh, that sounds too complicated. All right, I will! Son, I don\\'t think you should let me help you. Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons! You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit. I like our chances, son. This is my son and if he doesn\\'t want to wear one you can\\'t make him! Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute! Are you nervous son? Okay Bart, we\\'ve got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I\\'m gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks... Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we\\'re Team Simpson. When did I ever teach you that? Don\\'t be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad. I\\'ll just sit here in \"Li\\'l Lightnin\\'\" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son. Ow. Why? What\\'s wrong? Oh, sure, I\\'ll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you\\'ll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn\\'t it, Lisa? Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker! No! I\\'m not pouting, you are. Sorry. No. Can\\'t think of a thing. Leave me alone. Name your son\\'s hobbies. Building a soapbox racer... \"Name your child\\'s friends.\" Martin... Martin! I\\'ll curse that name \\'til the day I die... Huh? \"Who is your son\\'s heroe?\"... Three-time Soapbox Derby Champion Ronnie Beck! Wow, I\\'m one question away from being a perfect father. \"Name another dad you talked to about parenting.\" Shut up Flanders. Flanders! Flanders, Flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating? Great, thanks. I talked to Flanders about parenting. I\\'m a perfect father. Hold on, son, I\\'m-a coming! Do it for your old man, boy! That\\'s my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Wow, infotainment. He\\'s not so fat. Bart, why are you still up? Boy, they\\'ve got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego. What is it, boy? Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man. Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad? You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it\\'s the law. Heh, heh. Run for it boy! That\\'s it. I\\'m outta here. What\\'s the matter, Moe? Yeah, things are tough all over. Could I get a beer? Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself... One night Marge\\'s beastly sisters were showing slides from their latest vacation. As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink. Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment? I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle. In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids\\' cough syrup. It passed the first test: I didn\\'t go blind. I don\\'t know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good. A \"Flaming Homer\". Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup? Try lighting it on fire. Well, it\\'s called a \"Flaming... Moe, I haven\\'t seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it? Why yes I -- I\\'ll tell you what\\'s wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him! Take that off this second! I need to talk to Moe. I didn\\'t even tell you my name. Homer Simpson. But-- Barney? You\\'re my kid\\'s teacher! No! Get away from me. Hey, Moe? I\\'d rather have a \"Flaming Homer\". How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it. If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise. Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. You just lost yourself a customer! I said, you just lost yourself a customer! You just lost yourself a customer. You just lost yourself a customer, Moe! You just lost yourself a customer. You just lost yourself a customer. Ah, my new watering hole. A beer? Can I have a clean glass? Stupid Moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing... pug-nosed... Oooh! Look at me, I\\'m making people happy. I\\'m the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane! Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic. Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe. Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe... Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your Flaming Moe\\'s. All the time wondering, \"How does he do it?\" Well, I\\'m going tell you. The secret ingredient is... Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children\\'s cough syrup! Hi, Moe. Where\\'s that waitress of yours? Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. I guess so. Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You\\'re the greatest friend a guy could ever have.',\n",

He\\'d say... oh, think of a better opening. Not very well. Yes! Yes, Mom. Okay, America. Inspire me. Wow, a bald eagle. Hmm... Thanks for driving me to the contest, Dad. When America was born on that hot July day in 1776, the trees in Springfield Forest were tiny saplings, trembling towards the sun. And as they were nourished by Mother Earth, so too did our fledgling nation find strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice. Who would have thought such mighty oaks, or such a powerful nation, could grow out of something so fragile... so pure. Thank you. Okay. Bart! There\\'s no such thing as first bedsies. You just made that up. Iiiiiii Waaaaaannt... That one. Why? What\\'s wrong with it? No, really, what? What did you do to it? MOMMM! Have either of you ever run into any problems because of your superior ability? Ah, me too! Barbara Bush. Hello, sir. Only two. I checked. Mom? I\\'m too excited to sleep. Anyone up for the Winifred Beecher Howe Memorial? An early crusader for women\\'s rights. She led the Floormop Rebellion of 1910. Later she appeared on the highly unpopular 75 cent piece. Okay, but you don\\'t know what you\\'re missing. \"I will iron your sheets when you iron out the inequities in your labor laws.\" Amen, sister. How could I read my essay now? I don\\'t believe my own words. Honest Abe. He\\'ll show me the way. Mr. Lincoln, I... Mr. Lincoln, my name is Lisa Simpson, and I have a problem. Mr. Jefferson, my name is Lisa Simpson, and I have a problem. Sorry, sir. It\\'s just that... Uh, maybe I should be going. I caught you at a bad time. The truth must be told. I would like to read a different essay, if I may. \"The city of Washington was built on a stagnant swamp some 200 years ago, and very little has changed. It stank then, and it stinks now. Only today, it is the fetid stench of corruption that hangs in the air.\" \"And who did I see taking a bribe, but the \"Honorable\" Bob Arnold. But don\\'t worry, Congressman, I\\'m sure you can buy all the votes you need with your dirty money. And this will be one nation, under the dollar, with liberty and justice for none.\" I\\'m sorry, Dad. I couldn\\'t think of a nice way to say America stinks. I can\\'t believe it! The system works. Bart! The Flanders are having a beef-a-thon! Incredible Ned-ibles! Maude-acious vittles!. Dad, do you know what Schadenfreude is? It\\'s the German term for \"shameful joy\" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others. Sour grapes. Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it! Hey, quit it, quit it, quit it! M-o-o-o-m! You change it. Okay, okay. But Bart -- I\\'m sure you did nothing to discourage this, you scavenger of human misery. Hey!! You give that back. That belongs to me! That\\'s mine! Hey, stop that. Not any more. You punks are about to get a taste of your own medicine. This is my brother... and he knows Karate. Yeah, just keep laughing, it only makes him madder. Come on, Bart, start them off with the touch of death and go from there. It\\'s funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right. What are you so happy about? No one wants your stupid police badge, Bart. I\\'m gonna eat EIGHT pieces of chocolate. I think this is something Bart would really have enjoyed. But it\\'s the only way he\\'ll learn. Bart, is your boss a crook? Dad, I think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and Larry King. Bart, that\\'s so sweet. May I see the card? Hey there ten-year old. I couldn\\'t afford to get you a new drum... ...so how about a nice pair of bongos? Ewww. Bart, you\\'re not laughing. Too subtle? A role model in my very own home. How convenient. Maybe you ate a clove. How Zen. Looking at you with quiet awe. I will, Mr. Gumbel. But if you\\'ll excuse me, I\\'m profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick. Uh, excuse me, I have the chocolate milk. He\\'s just a little nervous. He has to give a speech tomorrow on \"How To Keep Cool In A Crisis.\" Our dad... now he belongs to the ages. No, Dad, Krusty is our guest. Your pratfalls and Punchinello antics aren\\'t necessary here. Why don\\'t we let our guest do it? No, Dad, that\\'s Hebrew. Krusty must be Jewish. Dad, There are many prominent Jewish entertainers including Lauren Bacall, Dinah Shore, William Shatner, and Mel Brooks. Poor Krusty, he\\'s like a black velvet painting come to life. Come on... Krusty, please continue. That is so sad. A man who envies our family is a man who needs help. Let\\'s move. No, no. We\\'re not converting, we just want to find a Rabbi Krustofsky. I didn\\'t know that. Oh yeah, it\\'s all the kids talk about on Monday at school. I bet the rabbi misses Krusty. Excuse us, Rabbi Krustofsky? Bart, we\\'re gonna have to out smart him. Bart, we\\'ve been going about this all wrong. What\\'s the one thing rabbis prize above everything else? No Bart. Knowledge. We\\'re gonna hit him where it hurts. Right in the Judaica. This looks good Bart. Take it to him. Not quite. I got some dynamite stuff from Rabbi Simon ben Eleazar. Here you go, Bart. It\\'s a long shot, but, that\\'s all I can do without learning ancient Hebrew. Bart! I am not gonna learn ancient Hebrew. There, there, Rabbi. It\\'s not too late. I didn\\'t select this costume for mobility. I wore it to salute the noble native American of the Pacific Northwests... YAHHH! Oh yeah, three bad nightmares. Dad, that\\'s Monaco. No, Bart. Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth. Oh, no! Maggie made a wish! Yaaayyy!! I wish for world peace. I had a bad dream. Could I sleep in your bed? Bart... Bart... I\\'ll give you a candy necklace. Thanks, Bart. Morning. Mom! Dad! Can we sleep with you? Hey, here\\'s a good job, Dad. Oh wait, you have to know how to operate a ultrasonic lithotryptor. Mom, what\\'s wrong? Whayda ya know, she\\'s right. Don\\'t forget dad, tonight my class is having an all you can eat spaghetti dinner. Dad, I\\'m calling about the school talent show. No. Dad, I broke my last saxophone reed, and I need you to get me a new one. I called her. She\\'s not home. I also tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement. Mom, where is he? If I don\\'t get that reed I\\'ll sound terrible. It\\'s not my fault. It\\'s the reed. I\\'m done. I\\'m sorry dad, I don\\'t feel much like eating. I forgive you. No. I didn\\'t. I love you, Dad! Snowball II... Santa\\'s Little Helper... this is Princess. Please don\\'t exclude her because she\\'s different. Dad, no! Dad, I think Princess belongs in a stable. Father, you\\'ve made me the happiest girl who ever lived. Wait, Dad, I\\'ve got something for you. You\\'re so beautiful. Oh look. You haven\\'t touched your salt lick. Num num, good salt lick. This next song is also about a girl and her pony. It\\'s called \"Wildfire.\" I just called to say I love you, Dad. What\\'s wrong with Dad? No. You\\'re gonna make me give up Princess? All the years I\\'ve lobbied to be treated like an adult has blown up in my face. She likes a little carrot after her oats. And she really likes it when you scratch her behind the ear. And if you\\'re playing the radio, she likes contemporary adult in the morning and easy listening at night. Please take good care of my Princess. I\\'ll never forget you. Dad, you don\\'t have to do this. Dad, I understand the sacrifice you\\'ve made for me. That\\'s why I gave up the pony. Hmmm hmmm. There\\'s a big dumb animal I love even more than that horse. I mean you, you dummy. Giddyup, Dad. Yes. Everything. Uh... take us to the video store. But, Dad, I can\\'t find \"Happy Little Elves in Tinkly Winkly Town\". Dad, can you take me to Dr. Hibbert\\'s office? Oh, nothing. I just scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I\\'m being a little anal, but barefoot season\\'s coming up and there\\'s a world of rusty nails out there. You should smell his room. That looks like an Olympic torch to me. Your husband could be an Olympic athlete who will go on to have a great acting career. The wax never lies. You\\'re telling who? Come here, Maggie. Mom, instead of milk for dinner, can I have a \"Virgin Moe?\" When Bart\\'s done, can we moe to the moevies? There\\'s a moetinee.',\n",

Her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her Daddy. That was our wedding. Children, it\\'s time for you to go to bed. Homie, did you straighten everything out...? Homer! You promised! Homer, please. We\\'ve never thrown a party. Now we\\'re gonna pay back all the friends who\\'ve invited us to their homes. Oh! They\\'re here! How does everything look? Do we have enough glasses? Homer! Homer! Put a record on! Children! Go! Now, Homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. Remember last year at the Winfield\\'s party when you threw up in the laundry hamper? I must apologize for my husband. Hmmm. thank you. I will, Dr. Hibbert. Thanks for coming. I have never been so embarrassed in my life. Come here! Shhh. I want to make sure the kids don\\'t hear. When I was young, I always hated knowing my parents were fighting. Homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night? Homer, I like to think that I\\'m a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. But last night, you didn\\'t just cross that line, you threw up on it! I\\'m going to church alone today. You\\'re going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred him for life. We\\'ll be there! We\\'re going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and that\\'s all. No fishing. Oh, that must be the babysitter. Hello. I\\'m Mrs. Simpson. Oh my. Where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice? Grampa? Grampa, could you do something? Well, I was wondering. Do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? I wouldn\\'t ask, except I\\'m desperate. Now, if Maggie runs a fever, you call this number. If she sticks her finger in an electrical socket, call this number. And if she drinks pine cleanser, call this... All right. All right. Goodbye, children. And behave yourselves. Call this number if Grampa falls in the bathtub. Hello, Reverend. We\\'re glad we could come. Oh, hello Helen. Oh, Homer. Well, it\\'s not that I don\\'t love the guy. I\\'m always sticking up for him. It\\'s just that he\\'s so self-centered. He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes... He blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle... ... He drinks out of the carton. He never changes the baby. When he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. Oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. I guess that\\'s it. Oh no. Wait. He kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. That\\'s all I can think of right now. I guess you\\'re all tired and I want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest. Homer, you\\'re sneaking out to go fishing? I can\\'t believe your selfishness. You can go fishing anytime, but we\\'re here trying to save our marriage. You\\'re thinking about fishing, even when I\\'m talking... right now. Right? Yes. Get back in bed. Sure. Homer? Do I have to do this? We came to this retreat because I thought our marriage was in trouble, but I never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. Homer, how can you expect me to believe.... To who? All this fish represents is just how selfish you are. Oh yeah, sure. Ohhh, Homer. Oh my, the house looks wonderful. Grampa, what\\'s your secret? Kids, could you lighten up a little? We\\'re here! So, did you kids have fun? Ohhh. Homer! Don\\'t gloat, Homer. You know, Bart, when I was your age, the one thing I wanted more than anything in the world was a Child-sized Electric Lightbulb Oven. My parents wouldn\\'t give me the money, so I went to my sisters, Patty and Selma... For months, I worked and worked, while my sisters smoked and smoked... But the big day finally came. And because I\\'d worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good. So maybe a part-time job is the answer. The poor boy is so desperate. He wants to earn money to buy a comic book. I don\\'t think so. Did you make any money? Well, I think what you\\'re doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. The poor old thing doesn\\'t have anybody. I thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s\\'mores. Homer, it\\'s really coming down. Could you check on the boys? Boys, you better come in the house. You don\\'t want to get the sniffles. Now come on... You can play your little tie-up game inside. I\\'ve got some cocoa on the stove. Who wants imitation marshmallows? What are you doing, honey? Lisa, we did the best we could... What\\'s a zebu? A-Positive. A mother knows everything about her family. Four B. Sixteen permanent, eight baby. XL. I don\\'t want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three. Butterscotch and imitation butterscotch. Glow in the dark monster make-up. Oh, Homie, you have lots of hair... Why did you want to know your blood type? Bart does. Bart, you have to help someone in need. It\\'s the only decent thing to do. The meaning of what? Homer, you don\\'t do things like that to be rewarded. You do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand. We got exactly what we wanted out of this: We gave an old man a second chance. But he\\'s your boss. Do you have to mail it right this minute? You\\'re still angry, Homer. Why don\\'t you sleep on it? Please, Homie? For me? Homer... Breakfast is ready. Oh... thank you. Homer, I don\\'t think it\\'s in the cornstarch canister. Homer, you encouraged him. You should be strangling yourself. Honey, what\\'s done is done. No matter what happens, we\\'ll pull through. We always do. Oh, my! It\\'s Mr. Burns. It doesn\\'t do anything. Whatever it does, it\\'s doing it now. Homer, it\\'s the thought that counts. The moral of this story is, \"A good deed is its own reward.\" Well then, I guess the moral is, \"No good deed goes unrewarded.\" Well... then I guess the moral is, \"The squeaky wheel gets the grease.\" But it certainly was a memorable few days! Bart, watch Maggie while I get the laundry. Maggie! Bart, I asked you to watch your sister! I washed it. Now Homer, don\\'t panic. You have plenty of white shirts. I don\\'t know how this could have happened. Homer, please. No one\\'s going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work. Homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. I can\\'t fill this out for you. Oh my God! Mother was right. I told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house. I said crazy house! Crazy house! Crazy house! Doctor, if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son, Bart, you\\'d see how sane he is. Oh, Homie. Well, at least we got a free sample of Reading Digest. No, it is not the truth, Homer. It\\'s well documented that women are safer drivers than men. You\\'ve certainly taken a shine to that magazine. Homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article. Homie... Put down your magazine for a minute... I thought you might want to snuggle. Thank you, Homie. It certainly has enriched our lives. Bart, maybe this is something you\\'d like to do, too. How\\'s it going, honey? Well, when I used to get stuck like this, I\\'d go for a bike ride. Do kids go on bike rides anymore? I don\\'t know, I thought maybe bikes weren\\'t cool anymore. Do kids still use that word, \"cool\"? Oooh, look, Homer. The IRS. Here we are, kids! The Watergate. Homer, look! They give you a shower cap, and body gel and bathrobes... Ooh, and a welcoming mint on your pillow. Wow, the President\\'s bathroom! Lisa, the contest isn\\'t for three hours. I know, honey, but just sit still. Lisa, what\\'s gotten into you? Imprisoned Congressman becomes born-again Christian. No, that was about the budget gap. This is the trading gap. I think it means he\\'s having a barbecue. He\\'s trying to be friendly. You know, if you gave Ned Flanders a chance -- We can\\'t hold it against him, just because he has things a little better than we do -- Oh, Homer. Hi, Ned. Homer sends his apologies, but uh... there was some important work at the plant that only he could take care of. Bart, how many hours a day do you watch TV? Don\\'t you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise? That\\'s the problem. Even as we speak, millions of children are staring at the TV instead of getting some much-needed exercise. Those children\\'s parents should be ashamed of themselves. That sounds fine, Bart. So Bart, what did you learn in karate school today? Bart, don\\'t use the touch of death on your sister. Homer, this is the Flanders\\' entire living room set. How much did you pay for this? Seventy-five dollars? Ned must be desperate! You got a job? Doing what? Bart, your father and I don\\'t want you doing that. Homer, say something. Homer? Homer! I know it\\'s good for a boy to have a part-time job, but I\\'m not sure about the people Bart\\'s working for. I thinks they\\'re criminals. Well, Bart\\'s been acting very strangely. And that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks. How long does it take to deliver a pizza? Homer, I want you to go down to that club and talk to them. Just see what kind of people they are. Please, Homie? Homer, what did you find out? Oh, Bart. Why couldn\\'t you have gotten a paper route like other boys. Principal Skinner! Well, they said they changed it just enough so they don\\'t have to pay us. Oh my Lord! Homie, please be all right. Dear Lord, if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, I\\'ll try to be a better Christian. I don\\'t know what I can do... Ummm, oooh, the next time there\\'s a canned food drive I\\'ll give the poor something they\\'d actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix. Homer, did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham? And what\\'s all this? \"For heroic competence... for narrowly averting a melt-down and proving, without question, that nuclear power is completely safe... Employee-of-the-Month!\" Ohh, Homer! How are you enjoying your ham, Homie? Hmm, it\\'s actually more of a honey glaze -- Bart, don\\'t feed your sister hotels! I think that game is too old for her. Why don\\'t you go play with Milhouse? You mean you still haven\\'t made up with him? Mrs. Van Houten, I\\'m Bart\\'s mother -- we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint. Look, I know Bart can be a handful but I also know what he\\'s like inside. He\\'s got a spark. It\\'s not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things... Well, I can\\'t defend everything he does. But let\\'s face it, all Bart and Milhouse have is each other. They\\'re too young for girls. And they\\'re a popular target for bullies. And in the Christmas pageant, they\\'re always sheep. Please, please, let them be friends! Well, I knew his mother would come to her senses.. What makes you think I did it? You be good. Hello? Oh hello, Mrs. Pennycandy. Oh, dear. This is the fifth time he\\'s cancelled. How can he hurt someone who loves him so? Well, thank you for calling. Good-bye. Sweetie, I\\'m sorry, but Krusty isn\\'t coming to dinner again. Bart, wipe your feet. I\\'ve got some good news. Krusty the Clown is coming to dinner tonight. Yes. Who wants to say grace? Krusty, why don\\'t you tell us what\\'s wrong? You\\'ll feel better. Well, look at the time. Almost midnight. Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home. We\\'re home! Now children, you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for... If you eat too much you\\'ll have nightmares. Look everybody! My purse exploded! Ugghh, Homer. Where did you get that ugly thing? Homer, there\\'s something I don\\'t like about that severed hand. Oh, my land! Ooh, a new pacifier. Homer, maybe fame and fortune aren\\'t as bad as they say. Oh Homer, this is awful. Good morning, dear. Much better! Oh good, the curtains are on fire! Now hadn\\'t you better get ready for school? Bart! That\\'s it, young man. You\\'re coming with me... Please? My goodness, what\\'s wrong? It\\'s your father, he\\'s missing. He\\'s been gone for two days. Did you have a nightmare, Homie? Don\\'t worry, honey, I\\'m sure your father is... Maybe. No. That\\'s a long shot. Bingo. Don\\'t worry, he\\'ll be here. Look Homer, Lisa\\'s taking her first steps. Yes. Did you hear that, Homer? Homer, if you want to make up with Lisa just spend some time with her. Homie, you\\'ve got to stop looking for the quick fix. If you keep spending time with Lisa, she\\'ll forgive you. We can\\'t afford to buy a pony. That\\'s ridiculous. That\\'s no reason to buy a pony! Stick to the subject. Let\\'s be realistic. A pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is. You sound like you\\'re going to buy a pony. Promise me you won\\'t. What was that? Was that a yes or a no? Those aren\\'t even words! I am very upset with you. Homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse? That\\'s illegal. Hmm, oh dear, we\\'re in serious trouble here. We\\'re just going to have to cut down on luxuries. Actually, I was thinking we could cut down on your beer. Then I\\'m afraid there\\'s no choice but to give up the pony back. Homer... All right. You got us into this, you get us out. Homer, where have you been? I was so worried. Homie, how long do you plan to do this? Thirty years? He\\'s just exhausted. Lisa, do you know how much it costs to keep a pony? Well, it\\'s a lot. In fact, your father had to take a second job. The Kwik-E-Mart. Lisa, I hope you realize that your father can\\'t keep this up. Lisa, we can\\'t make you give up that pony. No, Bart. No one\\'s going to make her. This is something Lisa has to decide for herself. Homer, can you get the door? It\\'s my sisters. Homer, be nice. What\\'s the matter, can\\'t you find a hair style you like? Ed Asner? Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again? Who\\'s using the power tools? Well, we\\'re going to the beauty parlor. Maybe you should do something with the kids while I\\'m gone. I don\\'t know. Homie, we\\'re back. Homer, could you turn off the TV? There\\'s a little test I want you to take. This is from the National Fatherhood Institute. It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father. Question one: \"Name one of your child\\'s friends...\" They want a name, Homer, not a vague description. Hank?! Hank who? Homer, you made that up. Question two: \"Who is your son\\'s hero?\" That\\'s your hero. \"Name another dad you talked to about parenting.\" What are your son\\'s hobbies? He hasn\\'t done that since he was two. Oh really? Well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see. Now, don\\'t pout. Don\\'t you at least have something to say to Bart? Homer! I\\'ve always said you were a good father. I\\'ve always defended you when people put you down. But I guess I was wrong. You are a bad father. Bart, you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner. Honey, what\\'s wrong? Homie, why don\\'t you just go down to Moe\\'s and talk to him? I bet he\\'d be willing to share some of his success with you. So, Mr. Hutz, does my husband have a case? Well Homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy. Well, duh. Bart, are you going to moe the lawn today? I moe, I moe. Of course. All work and moe play makes Moe a moe moe.',\n",

And yours truly will take it Wednesdays and Saturdays. Well, Sunday possession will be determined by a random number generator. I will take the digits one through three. Milhouse will have four through six. And Bart will have seven through nine. Well, in the unlikely event of a zero, possession will be determined by \"Rock, Scissor, Paper\" competition. Best three out of five, how\\'s that? Excellent! Well, today being Saturday, Gentlemen, I guess I\\'ll be taking my comic and... If the comic book stays right here, then so do I. Milhouse, the acids in your hands could damage the newsprint. We want to keep this comic forever, so the last one alive will have the honor of being buried with it. I meant years from now. I have to go to the bathroom, Bart. Bart, is this how you treat all your guests? I don\\'t know. Is it worse than what you do with people that have to go to the bathroom? Bart, the comic! You know, if you guys hadn\\'t tied me up, I could be saving the comic as we speak. I\\'d raise my hand, Mrs. Simpson, if I could. It\\'s no use, fellows. Another comic book has returned to the earth from whence it came. Milhouse, I\\'d like to express my appreciation for Saturday. Jelly bean baskets, personalized noisemakers -- those little touches are what made it enduring. A conventional design. In between some other projects. Well, gentlemen, if you\\'ll excuse me, I\\'ve booked some time at the wind tunnel. Attention, everyone. I say to those who question the value of the space program... Behold! You know, Bart, I don\\'t care who wins, as long as one of us beats that guy. Oh my. I didn\\'t realize this hill was so high. Could I have another minute -- Aaah! Aieee! Deploy, damn you, deploy! It hurts! It hurts! Owee-owee-owee-ow! But that means I can\\'t possibly race! Save your palliative cliches for the next poor sap, Doctor. Thanks, Bart. That racer transformed me into the twisted creature you see before you. I\\'ll never race again. Even if I wanted to, I\\'m in no shape to do it. Unless... Bart, will you drive my car? Tell me something I don\\'t know. Mr. Simpson, you have every right to be angry. But rest assured, your son loves you... Bart, if she breaks up on you, steer away from the grandstands, or else you might kill hundreds of innocent spectators. Bart what did I just tell you? What is the matter with you? Forget about your father. You\\'re driving for me now! I might remind you both, I did design that racer. The driver is essentially ballast. So the next time you use a gas chromatograph, remember to thank Mister A.J.P Martin.',\n",

And how, may I ask, did you get past the hall monitors? Stop! I suppose you\\'re all wondering where I\\'ve been. It all started a week ago. I was at my desk, revising and updating the school dress codes, when... I was suddenly confronted by a gang of toughs acting on behalf of one Bart Simpson. Or so they said. Get out! To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. But suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently. For the next week I stayed alive by eating my mother\\'s delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand. I made a game of it, seeing how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that record. Occasionally the police arrived to search my home. I shouted until I was hoarse, but they couldn\\'t hear me. I\\'M IN HERE!!! Finally I realized if I was ever going to get out of there, I would have to do it myself. I formed a crude rocket from a discarded cigar tube. And remembering an experiment from my days as a fourth grade science teacher, I concocted a fuel from baking soda and the juice of discarded lemon wedges. The rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide, dragging behind it the end of a vacuum cleaner cord. I grabbed on to the vacuum cleaner, pushed the cord retractor button and was on my way to freedom. And that\\'s my courageous story. They called me old-fashioned for teaching the duck and cover. But who\\'s laughing now? Your attention please. This is Principal Skinner. Bart, this one\\'s for you. Hello ma baby, hello ma honey, hello my ragtime gal... Send me a kiss by wire..

Uh, sir, that was my costume from the plant production of H.M.S. Pinafore. Careful, men. He wets his pants. Homer Simpson, sir. Simpson, put that box on Mr. Burns\\' desk. Chop, chop! Got me, sir. Okay, but you softened it up for me, sir. But sir, how? That Simpson boy is looking at a hundred and eighty years. T.G.I.M., Sir. Well, I caught up on my laundry. And wrote a letter to mother. Oh, here\\'s the kicker, I took Hercules out to be clipped. He\\'s my Yorkshire terrier, sir. He\\'s kind of tiny, so... you know, it\\'s a joke. Here\\'s a picture of Herkie. May I ask how you spent your weekend? Homer Simpson, sir. Actually sir, he was hired under \"Project Bootstrap.\" Sir, where\\'s my radiation suit? Sir, there may never be another time to say... I love you, sir. May I, sir? Yes sir. Sir, about Employee-of-the-Month... I-I-if you\\'ll recall, I\\'m the one who put a five percent ceiling on the Keogh Plan, which saved this company -- Couldn\\'t help it, sir. The parking here is terrible. Oh, in the meantime, sir, may I suggest a random firing... just to throw the fear of God into them. Attention Homer Simpson. Attention Homer Simpson. Wake up, Homer. You\\'re fired. For sleeping on the job. We\\'ve been watching you on the surveillance camera. How long till it\\'s up and running, sir? What corpse should we unearth, sir? What a minute, sir. That\\'s Homer Simpson. He wasn\\'t exactly a model employee. Ehhh... Simpson will do just fine, sir. Did you hear that, sir? It\\'s the man in the bag, sir. I think he\\'s alive. Thank you, sir. Ice cream scoop? Sir, his family might appreciate it if you returned the brain to his body. Sir, do you know what this means? He is alive. Run, sir! Sir, is there nothing I can do? Shut up, Simpson. Do you have any collateral? I didn\\'t do anything funny, sir.',\n",

It\\'s not in here. You stole it! Hey, that is my badge, Homer. ... Lousy prize-grabbing... badge-wearing... You ate my homework? I did not know dogs really did that. Wait! Wait! But I am only... ... ... five... ten... twenty... forty minutes? That\\'s pretty damn late. Hey girls! Look at me! You can stop lookin\\' at me now. What a day. You\\'re making me lick envelopes? What kind of game? Sounds like a pretty crappy game to me. No thir. Tan Die Doe Dow? Tan... Die.... Doe... Dow. Die don\\'t. What next? Uh-oh. Hands off the material! Eat my shorts. Don\\'t have a cow. Cool! I do not know. I am not sure I... Oh... I dunno... mixing drinks, picking horses, cuttin\\' cigars... you know -- a job. Thirty bucks a week. I was lookin\\' for those. Thanks, doll. No. They\\'re not mine. My boss said his warehouse was full. Right in here my man. I do not think so. Although it would explain an awful lot. Thanks... uh... Say, are you guys crooks? No. Uh-uh. I guess that is okay. Hell no! Supoib. THOSE FINGERS THROUGH MY HAIR / THAT SLY COME HITHER STARE / THAT STRIPS MY CONSCIENCE BARE / IT\\'S WITCHCRAFT - GIMME THREE FINGERS OF MILK, MA. More \"stink lines\" boys. You is not seen nothin\\'. Now beat it. Lousy Skinner. Of course I am late for work. How can I be on time when Principal Skinner keeps me after school? He sure is, Patrone. Uh-oh. That is not funny, Lewis. That\\'s not true! It\\'s just a rumor! You\\'re engaged in speculation. I know the law. You cannot prove anything. Reverend Lovejoy! You\\'ve... you have come to comfort me? Did you kill my principal? No! My principal! What\\'s that guy doing here? Hey! Get bent. Sorry Fat Tony. I used to think your gang was cool, but now I learned that crime does not pay. Cool! \"To me bestest bud Milhouse, Happy Birthday, Bart.\" C\\'mon, open it open it open it. Aw Milhouse, just cuz your mom did not let you have a party does not mean you cannot get a present. What are you girls talkin\\' about? Twins. Open your present. They\\'re official Krusty the Clown walkie-talkies. I will keep one and you keep one. Now whenever you want to talk to me, just call me on the phone and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie. What\\'s he talkin\\' about? Wow, brown! You did have a party. You did not invite me. And I thought we were best friends. My best friend shafted me. I will never get over this, Otto-man. Milhouse, a little salt? What\\'s she got against me? Bad influence my ass! How many times have I told you, never listen to your mother! Whatever she is paying you, I will double it. Nah. I am just depressed. Milhouse\\'s mom will not let me play with him any more. I had a fight with Milhouse. One... two... three... Community chest. Nah. Nah. Ah. I have won second prize in a beauty contest. Collect ten bucks. Ha ha! You\\'re losing. Don\\'t worry mom, there is tons of these things. I do not wanna play with Milhouse. It\\'s his mom. She says I am a bad influence. C\\'mon Maggie, let us go throw rocks at that hornet\\'s nest. Who cares?! Milhouse, I will be right there! Sorry Maggie, game\\'s over. Hey Mom, I am friends with Milhouse again. Who else would? I will. Yes, sir? Okay Milhouse, how many Krusty autographs should I put you down for? Consider it done. YOU\\'RE WALKING ALONG THE STREET/ OR YOU\\'RE AT A PARTY/ OR ELSE YOU\\'RE ALONE/ AND THEN YOU SUDDENLY DIG... DIG... DIG. THIS COULD BE THE START OF SOMETHING BIG... Aw, man. Dear Krusty, this is Bart Simpson, Krusty Buddy #16302 respectfully returning his Badge... ...I always suspected that nothing in life mattered. Now I know for sure. Get bent, Bart Simpson. Why bother, they will just get dirty again. He is, for sure? God bless that clown. Milhouse. You can come in and drop the charade. Krusty, you do not have to be \"on\" tonight. Yeah, just relax and be yourself. Krusty, would you do the honors? Krusty, are you alright? Yeah, spill your guts, man. Don\\'t worry, I do not even like using the bathroom after you. Krusty, do you think about your father a lot? Yeah, I have got a lot of fond memories. Goodnight, Krusty. Sorry about your dad. No! Oh great, we came all this way and it is the wrong guy. Poor Krusty. We\\'ve got to do something. Reverend Lovejoy, we need you to help us find a rabbi. Really? Oh, oh, that radio show. We\\'ll put them on later. Now can you give us the rabbi\\'s address? He\\'ll be so happy, he will be crying in his beard. We came to talk to you about your son. Hello, my name\\'s Dimitri. I am a first time caller, long time listener. My question is, \"If a son defies his father, and chooses a career that makes millions of children happy, should not the father forgive the son?\" Don\\'t worry, Lis. I have got a plan that cannot fail. Yiddle my man, you are a genius. Speaking of charity, Rabbi Krustofsky, do not you think it is time you forgave your son? Oy, this guy\\'s tough. I do not know, he is pretty sharp. He saw right through this disguise. Au revoir. Sorry, no. Just get us another bowl of complimentary pickles. Those stupid hats? Ahhh, Noah, Noah, save us, save us... No!! But... but... but, but Rabbi, does it not say in the Babylonian Talmud... And I quote, \"A child should be pushed aside with the left hand, and drawn closer with the right.\" Then does not your religion command you to make up with Krusty? Oh, it is hopeless. At all times let a man be supple as a reed and not rigid as a cedar. Is it not written in the Talmud, \"Who will bring redemption? The jesters.\" Rabbi, did not a great man say, and I quote, \"The Jews are a swinging bunch of people. I mean, I have heard of persecution, but what they went through is ridiculous! But the great thing is after thousands of years of waiting and holding on and fighting, they finally made it.\" End quote. Nope. Nope. Nope. I am afraid not, Rabbi. It\\'s from \"Yes, I Can\" by Sammy Davis Jr. An entertainer like your son. Heh heh heh...Jackpot! We would have gotten even more if Lisa could walk faster. Oh, yeah. Everybody in the family is gonna have a bad nightmare tonight. I can do that but I do not wanna. Let\\'s wish for x-ray specs that really work. X-ray specs. X-ray specs. X-ray specs. X-ray spects. Okay, no more fooling around. Paw, this is Bart. I wish for the Simpsons to be rich and famous. Jeez, now we are slaves. This paw sucks. Huh?... S\\'matter? No. Climb aboard. Less talk, more sleep. Good morning. Every day, same old cat. I will make him more interesting. Oh, there. That\\'s better. Okay. Hi guys. Hi Otto. Move over. I am driving. Quit riding the brake, Otto. Give it some gas, man. Phone. I love school. I want to watch Krusty. Do I ever! Good night, dad. You know, these last few days have been really swell. I wish there was something I could do to repay you. You got it. I love you, dad. Yaahhh! We both had nightmares. Hey, Dad. Here\\'s one. Twenty-eight dollars an hour, plenty of fresh air... and you get to meet lots of interesting people. Grave digger. Dad\\'s missing? Get outta here. Hey, man, you were crushing me. I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab. I would like to open with my impression of Principal Skinner. Duh, look at me, I am Principal Skinner. Hey, it is Lunchlady Doris. I wonder what she is got for us today. Today\\'s special is refried dog poop. Hey, how come Lisa gets a pony? I do not love you either. So give me a moped. Grampa, if you wanna go right... ... move your joystick to the left. Uh-oh, here comes a Xylon cruiser. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go into hyperspace! Ready, hit it! Grampa, you are the spaceship, not the... Game\\'s over, Grampa. Busted! Oh my God, she killed him. Well, it is still fun to be up late. Hey, Homer, where ya goin\\'? The poor guy. Where\\'s he working? I can make her. Just give me five minutes alone with her. Hey, pink hat, when I ordered that blueberry squishee, I meant today. And fill it to the top this time. Hey, Dad, you got a power drill? Check. Hey, Homer, I cannot find the safety goggles for the power saw. Oh, check. What? No, not really. Building a Soap Box Derby racer. Hey, so it is. Well, as three-time soapbox derby champ Ronnie Beck says, \"Poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine.\" Oh, yeah? Are you building a racer, Martin? Maybe it is for the best. Thanks, but I am almost done. Why do not you get back on the couch and watch TV? Sorry dad, but three time Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dad\\'s help. Come on Dad, it would be weird. Ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes. Helmets are for wusses, Sir. Aye carumba! It\\'s over there, Nelson. What was that? Don\\'t worry, Dad, as three time Soap Box derby champion Ronnie Beck says, \"Gravity is my co-pilot.\" Is it okay to visit? Hey man, cool crash. Way to cheat death. You had the best stick out there, man. I wish I could build \\'em like you. If you do not race, then Nelson\\'ll win! Oh, I do not know if I should do that. My dad and I built our car together and if I drove someone else\\'s it would kill him. On the other hand... I will do it. Dad... I do not know how to say this, but I do not want to drive your car. It\\'s slow, it is ugly, it handles like a shopping cart... Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win. Well, I picked it up somewhere. And if I drive Martin\\'s car I can win. I am sorry, but... Dad, are not you coming? Dad, you gotta come. I just got your hat out of the fridge. Kill spectators. It\\'s my dad. Lying there on the couch drinking a beer, staring at the TV. I have never seen him like that. Let\\'s rock. Thanks, Mr. Beck. I was alone out there, but someone was riding with me in spirit... This is for you, Dad. Thanks, Nelson, put her there. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Loser! Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah! Mom, I never won before. I may never win again. Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah! Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Whoa, T and A. Lisa\\'s slumber party. Who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me? What the... ? Aaahhh! Ptew!! Ptew!! I am telling Mom and Dad. Because I am \"jinxed\" dammit! Ow! What was that for? Aye carumba! \"The Inventor I Admire\", by Bart Simpson. The inventor I admire is, not a rich man, or a famous man, or even a smart man. He\\'s my father, Homer Simpson, creator of... the \"Flaming Homer\"! It\\'s not true! My father invented that drink, and if you will allow me to demonstrate... I brought enough for everybody. Okay. Uh, yes, I am looking for a friend of mine. Last name Jass, first name Hugh. Uh... hi. Bart Simpson. Uh, look. I will level with you, mister. This is a crank call that sorta backfired and I would like to bail out right now. Okay, but you promised me moe money.',\n",

I want to dictate... my epitaph. Charles... Montgomery... Burns. American Patriot ... American Patriot. Master Of The Atom. Scourge Of The Despot. \"O Tyrant Hear His Mighty Name And QUAKE!!\" Smithers, I am back! Oh, top o\\' the mornin\\' to ye! Why, look who is here! It\\'s good old... you! Oh, hey, there, Mr... Brown Shoes! How about that local sports team? Hm? Heh-heh-heh! Well, that is game! Hasta manana, Osvaldo! Smithers, I am back in the pink! Full of pith and vinegar! You know, it is funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and tonic and patent medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. By the way, what was the lad\\'s name? Who? Well, the Simpsons will be getting a very nice surprise in the mail. Very nice, indeed. I want the whole world to hear the story of my harrowing struggle with hypohemia. Excellent. Well, Countess Van Zeplin and I... What in blaze... Now you listen to me, you bargain basement Baudelaire. I am not some dizzy starlet who cannot string two words together. I can write this thing myself. You\\'re fired. \"Chapter the Fifth... A Trip to the Infirmary, With Most Unexpected Results.\" Can I help you? Oh, do not be frightened of this. It\\'s nothing but a letter opener. Who are you? Hello, there is more. \"In case you cannot tell, I am being sarcastic...\" \"...you stink, you are a senile, buck-toothed...\" \"...old mummy... with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant\\'s butt!\" I could crush him like an ant, but it would be too easy. No, revenge is a dish best served cold. I will bide my time until... Oh, what the hell. I will just crush him like an ant. \"Senile,\" eh? \"Buck-toothed,\" am I? \"Bony arms,\" are they? \"Liver spots,\" did I? \"Chinless,\" will you? Now, that is odd. I have just robbed a man of his livelihood, and yet I feel strangely empty. Tell you what, Smithers. Have him beaten to a pulp. But what? In closing, gentle reader, I would like to thank you. What\\'s that you say? Me thanking you? No, it is not a misprint. For you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much as you enjoyed reading it. The end. Ah Smithers, how did the beating go? What? Well that is a hell of a thing! Why? Judas! I see. No need, Smithers. As usual, you have been the sober \"ying\" to my raging \"yang.\" Put \\'er there, old pal. We do indeed, old friend. We do indeed. We\\'ll get the Simpsons a present, an extravagant present! A mad, unthinkable, utterly impossible present! A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present! Ooo, too practical. Too cutesy-poo. Too cornball. A pool table? Are you mad? I am not gonna turn his home into a saloon. Eureka! We\\'ve found it! Don\\'t you dare sully this moment with your price taggery! It\\'s perfect! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Why, what did you think I was going to do -- have you beaten to a bloody pulp? To show there is no hard feelings, please take an advance copy of my book, \"Will There Ever Be A Rainbow?\" And now, young fellow, I have not forgotten you. Here. Actually, son, it is a big, ugly Olmec Indian head. It was carved by Meso-American Indians over 3,000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xt\\'tapalatakettle, the god of war. Well, I will let you get acquainted with SeÃ±or Xt\\'tapalatakettle. Ta! Did you see their faces, Smithers? Wait a minute, go back. Zoom in. Why is that man in pink? Simpson, eh? Well, judging by his outlandish attire, he is some sort of free-thinking anarchist. Excellent. These color monitors have already paid for themselves. Spare me the tired semantics of the Simpson family! Take him away! Or perhaps you two are in cahoots. Smithers, I seem to recall you had a penchant for bell-bottom trousers back in \\'79. Oh, yes, of course. Your spirited hornpipe stole the show, as I recall. Now Doctor, what shall we do about our free wheeling fop over here? No. Who is that bookworm, Smithers? Simpson, eh? How very strange. His job description clearly specifies an illiterate. Ah! Look, Smithers, another member of our nuclear family, with some helpful suggestions. And what is your name? Simpson, eh? Hmm hmmm. I am Monty Burns. Hm. \"Keep that handsome owner out of sight. He\\'s distracting the female employees.\" Smithers... Oh! It\\'s a real one! \"No more apples in the vending machine, please.\" Well, that is almost a sentence! Oh, of course. And do not worry, there\\'ll be plenty of apples for you. Nobody will take away your precious apples. Now, now, now. Tell my secretary I said you could have a free apple. She\\'ll make everything all right, I promise. Damned infernal gizmo. My kingdom for a left-handed can opener! Smithers, I am licked. You open this can. Hold it, Smithers! I will open the can! To the mall! I will explain on the way! The world has turned has it not my tin-plated friend? Look at you -- you, who were once so proud -- Feel the wrath of the left hand of Burns! The boys at the Diners Club will think I have gone quite mad. Oh, and I will have that roadster in the corner as well. Huzzah for the shopkeep! Thank God we live in a country so hysterical over crime that a ten-year-old child can be tried as an adult. Ah, Monday morning. Time to pay for your two days of debauchery, you hung-over drones. Yeah. so, what did you do this weekend, Smithers? Who the devil is Hercules? Well, Smithers, do not you know how to paint the town red. Well, a bit overly familiar, but I will allow it. I took in a movie. An appalling little piece of filth. Its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the film strolling around naked as a jaybird. Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they will \\'oink\\' for more every time. Call me old-fashioned, but movies were sexier when the actors kept their clothes on. Vilma Banky could do more for me with one raised eyebrow than an entire... 7-G? Good God, who is the safety inspector there? Simpson, eh? Good man? Intelligent? Thank you, President Ford. Oh hello, Kent. Right now, skilled nuclear energy technicians are calmly correcting a minor, piffling malfunction. But, I can assure you and the public that there is absolutely no danger whatsoever -- -- things could not be more ship-shape. How the hell should I know? Oh, meltdown is one of those annoying buzzwords. I prefer to call it an unrequested fission surplus. Oh, hot dog. Thank you for making my last few moments on earth socially awkward. Oh, Smithers, I guess there is nothing left but to kiss my sorry butt good-bye! Yes, we have isolated the problem and would not you know? False alarm. It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system. Excellent. Well, \"ta\". Hmmm, Smithers, I can still sell \\'em snake oil. Now bring me a wine spritzer -- and do not be stingy with the vino. So, Smithers, it seems you have underestimated one Homer Simpson... our next Employee-of-the-Month. Smithers, you bean counter, give it up! Simpson\\'s my man! Simpson -- Monty Burns. Come with me. Now, now. That will do. Homer, for your bravery and skill, we award you this ham, this plaque, this discount coupon book, and my own personal thumbs up! And to insure your immortality, your heroic visage will be added to our Wall of Fame... Oh, and uh, what is this? A congratulatory phone call from Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson. Ah Simpson! There\\'s someone I want you to meet. Aristotle Amadopolis, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power facility. It seems Ari\\'s been having terrible worker problems at Shelbyville. We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of Homer Simpsons. Oh cut the false modesty, it is getting tiresome. Besides, it is your duty. Employee of the Month is not all ham and plaques. Well! Smithers, how kind of you to pay us a visit. Begone from my sight. That one\\'s always been a problem. Look at them, Smithers. Goldbrickers, lay-abouts, slug-a-beds... Little do they realize their days of suckling at my teat are numbered. Very well. Eeney, meany, miney... ugh, him. Smithers, to the laboratory. You know Smithers, I have always despised the laziness of the common worker. Then I realized his spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak. So I replaced the flesh -- which is weak -- with steel, which is strong. Behold, the greatest breakthrough in labor relations since the cat o\\' nine tails. Keep your pants on, Smithers. First, we need... The human brain. I do not know. I feel like a kid in a candy store. Hello! An open grave. Smithers, get him out quickly, the stench is overpowering. Oh, will you quit your complaining. Well, who is a model ... employee? No, I didn\\'t. Who is it? Frankenstein? The Booger Man? Oh... bad corpse. Bad corpse. Stop scaring Smithers. Satisfied? Excellent. Smithers, hand me that ice cream scoop. Damn it, Smithers. This is not rocket science, it is brain surgery. Hel-lo. Look at me, I am Davey Crockett. Look, Smithers, a twitch... it is moving. It\\'s alive! Oh, that fellow at Radio Shack said I was mad... well who is mad now?! Hi there. I am your dad-dy. It was not suppose to be this way. It was supposed to be a thing of beauty, not this abomination. Oh Smithers, I was wrong to play god. Life is precious, not a thing to be toyed with. Now, take out that brain and flush it down the toilet. Oh, come on. It\\'s 11:45. Oh, Smithers, when you look at me with those puppy dog eyes... all right. Oh you are right, Smithers. I guess I owe you a coke. And as for you, you clinking, clattering, cacophony of colligenous cogs and camshafts, take that. Ahhh! Every bone... shattered... organs... leaking vital fluids. Slight headache... loss of appetite. Smithers, I am going to die. Well, perhaps. Smithers go to my office. In the third drawer of my desk are surgical tools and some ether... Perhaps you are wondering why you have two heads? Well my body was crushed so I had my head grafted on to or shall we say ample frame. Oh that is right. It\\'s all a dream. Or is it? But Homer, tonight\\'s our reception for Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands. Hel-lo. Simpson, eh? How can I help you? It\\'s a hobby. I am not in this for any personal gain, heavens no. By the way, are you acquainted with our state\\'s stringent usury laws? Silly me, I must have just made up a word that does not exist. Now, what is the purpose of this loan? Isn\\'t that cute? Smithers, he is planning on joining the horsey set. That is it, is not it? You\\'re not planning to eat it? Oh Smithers, let us not be so cold. His spirit is my collateral.

Uh, uh I-I guess it would not do any good to run, because you are our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh? Well, I am still gonna run! I do not know. Great plan, Bart. Lisa, I do not know what you are doing, but it is very strange and your father is trying to worry. Oops. Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take. Homer Simpson. Yeah, well I will be on my -- Hey, c\\'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm? Oh, I have never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he is always kinda mad. Me and my big... letter writing pen! Okay, here is the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I\\'ll... die in a gutter. It\\'s practical and within our means. I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one. Oh, woe is me. Mr. Burns, you brought us a present. What did I tell you? I will bet it is filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls... Marge, what does it do? Marge! Really, what does it do? Save a guy\\'s life, and whattaya get? Nothin\\'! Worse than nothin\\'! Just a big, scary rock. Wait a minute. If I had not written that nasty letter, we would not have gotten anything! Exactly. It\\'s just a bunch of stuff that happened. Amen to that! Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt? Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink? Marge, I cannot wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I am not popular enough to be different. Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It\\'s all over, Marge. It\\'s all over. You! You did this to me! Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I am wearing a pink shirt, it does not mean I am some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting -- You do not understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry... Print name? Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form. All right, all right. I will get Lisa to do it. Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me? O-kay. No deal. Son, it is no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot? Look at him! Awww. Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire! Yes, I am hearing one right now, while I am trying to watch TV. Bart! Shut up or I will shut you up! So, did I pass? The devil with his fly open. That\\'s a spill on a floor with bugs goin\\' after it. They\\'re gonna eat it. Arrghh! The boy! This is not fair! How can you tell who is sane and who is insane? Who are you? I am Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons. Oh, of course I have heard of you. I mean you would have to be living under a rock not to know -- what\\'d you say your name was? Doesn\\'t ring a bell. What was that last one? Nope. Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet? No, that thing with your feet. Because I wore a pink shirt. What\\'d you wear? Bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl-- Hey, Michael, I do not get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me. Okay. Five times nine. Wowww. Hey, Chief. Gee, I gotta call my family. Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling \\'em from a nut house. I mean, they think I am a god. Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight. That\\'s all right, son. What\\'s that? This place is so strange. Mike, I am ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I\\'m... scared. Pancakes... football... Boobies... Was the door locked? Was it raining? Were you out of gas? Baby. Mmm... pancakes. Marge! That\\'s the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please? Not insane. Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us. You are? Why? Boy, when I get home, I am going to wrap my hands around your neck -- Now listen. I am bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn\\'t that cute -- he is heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice. Are you sure you are here voluntarily? Thanks everybody! It\\'s great to be sane. Here he is! Here\\'s the guy you wanna see. Huh? Huh? Come off. I am sane now. Not me. I got this. Stupid junk mail... \"You May Have Already Won!\" Yeah, win this... \"Here\\'s Good News for Homer Simpsoy\"... I will see that he gets it. How dumb do they think I am? Huh? A check? Oh yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure? Shut up. I had a feeling it was too good to be true. Every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal. Marge, I never read a magazine in my life and I am not gonna start now. Hey, a cartoon. \"Well dear, you always wanted a compact.\" -- Ain\\'t it the truth. Oh, Marge. Cartoons do not have any deep meaning. They\\'re just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh. Nah, you go ahead. As Tolstoy said in \"Quotable Notables,\" \"Give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread.\" Marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds. Ooh... How about the \"V\"? It\\'s not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket. Those kids do not know what they are missing. We\\'re all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival. Then I heard the sound that all Arctic explorers dread: The pitiless bark of the sea lion. He\\'ll be killed! Don\\'t be so... Oh, you are right. Hmph? That reminds me! \"Seven Ways To Spice Up Your Marriage.\" Marge, you have a nice body. And if you would like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask. Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong. And it was free. Free! Wow! \"Win a Trip to Washington D.C.\"! \"All expenses paid... VIP tour\"... Oh. It\\'s for kids. Ooh... And Miss? Just one more question -- Sweetheart, there is nothing I would not do for that magazine. YEAH! Damn right! Uh-uh. Woo hoo! Who would have guessed reading and writing would pay off? Playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot\\'s wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else I have got coming to me. We\\'re all gonna die! Look, Marge, that guy has the same last name we do... Taxi! BOOOOO! Wowww -- A shoehorn! Just like in the movies! Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Stupid welcoming mint! Y\\'ello. Wake-up call? It\\'s two AM! Free food?! Ooh! I love your magazine. My favorite section is \"How To Increase Your Word Power.\" That thing is really, really, really good. Miss? What does the \"I\" stand for? Ah! What does the \"I\" stand for again? Yeah, right. Mmmmmm... Money. Lousy cheap country... BART! Get out of the Spirit of St. Louis! Hey, what is so funny? Oh Marge, grow up. Who\\'s that? Bart, are you ready to go to... I will room service you... Yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin\\'. Gimme one of those! Give her the check! I was serious. I am almost done. I will be there. Not-y not-y not. Well, why does not he just say so? Oh, here we go again. Look, I do not care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he is a jerk. End of story. Excuse me? Better? Thanks a lot, Marge, you really put me in my place. Don\\'t get me wrong, it is worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. Marge Simpson... President of the International We Love Flanders Fan Club... Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead, Marge, have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They\\'d cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders\\'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders\\' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I would be laughing. Laughing from my grave. What is it, boy? What? Mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que. Hey, everyone, I am back! Great to see ya! Nice seein\\' ya! Hey, no tagbacks. The fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake... That was a joke? Uh... Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me. Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz? Nah. No, it isn\\'t. Hmm, let us see. Nah. Hmmm. Heyyyy. Keep your pants on, Flanders! I am wishing as fast as I can! Ooooh. Mmmm -- too far. Okay. Ready. Yesssss! Oh yessss! Read it and weep. In your face. I have got more chicken bone! Oooh. That would be a shame. Wouldn\\'t it, Flanders? Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It\\'s a boy\\'s best friend. See, Marge? You knock TV and then it helps you out. I think you owe somebody a little apology. Well, if it is not the Leftorium. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Hey Flanders, how is business? So, Flanders, have you sold anything? I am telling you, Flanders\\' store was dee-serted. So what do you think of your bestest buddy now, Marge? No, I do not know what Schadenfreude is. Please tell me, because I am dying to know. Oh, come on, Lisa. I am just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. He\\'s usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... What\\'s the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours? Boy, those Germans have a word for everything. Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks. Ooh, the touch of death. Hey, boy. How was class? Oh, that\\'ll learn \\'im. Hey Flanders, when are your busy hours? Lousy. He just sits there all day. He\\'d have a great job if he did not own the place. Uh, well actually, Moe... Apple, apple, apple... Come on candy bar. Hey, I know you! You\\'re that first apple I did not want. That sinks it. I am really gonna let \\'em have it this time! Homer Simpson, sir. Can I leave, Mr. Burns? But the note was asking you to -- Um, Mr. Burns... Sorry, Flanders. Huh? Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay? Oh, I get it. It\\'s not good enough for you, but it is good enough for me! Well, I would not be caught dead buying this... Hello! I will give you twenty bucks for it. You were swindled, my friend. Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it. Sorry! No cash for Neddie! Homer keep all money! Bye bye Neddie! Bye bye! Twenty dollars? Now I do not want it. I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest. Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney? Daddly-doodly. Only seventy-five beans! Oh, I know I need to pay them. But there is just so many. I know, but... Wait a minute. I am Homer Simpson. Ned Flanders lives over there. Flanders is in debt? Are you sure? Uh, there is a store where... Yeah. Knock \\'em dead, boy! Kid\\'s gonna be a black belt in no time. Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back. You\\'re gonna live in your car? I know! Why not? Oh. Oh, it is all my fault. Yes it is. No, I was a swine. Listen, Flanders, do you still have that store? Flanders, you open that store tomorrow! I SAID DO IT! Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson. Remember last month, when I paid back that loan? Well, now I need you to do a favor for me. C\\'mon, you lefties. What\\'d I tell you? It\\'s all here, and it is all backwards. That\\'s right. To Ned Flanders... the richest left- handed man in town. Hey, look what I got. A genuine official police badge... Calling all cars... come out with your hands up! That\\'s Officer Homer. Heh heh, heh, heh. How much does it pay? Pfft. I make more than that. ... Bart! Have you started smoking? Don\\'t lie to me boy. Aha! Cigarettes, just as I thought. Yeah, right. Son... I am gonna teach you a lesson. I am going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you will learn... Son, I will never doubt you again. A job\\'s a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal. See? It was all your imagination. Oh, all right. Hee hee, hee-hee-hee! Read \\'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes. You know if you need a hat check girl, I have got a daughter. Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding. Kill my boy! Kill my boy! Wait till I get you home, boy. Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it is true, it is true! All the pieces fit. I thought he was dead. Eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple. Hey, when do we get the check for this? You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers. Here\\'s good news. According to this eye-catching article, SAT scores are declining at a slower rate. Hey, this is the only paper in America that is not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine. What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets. Huh? Noise. Bad noise! Critical wha...? Okay, okay, do not panic. Whosever problem this is, I am sure they know how to handle it. Huh? AHHH!! It\\'s my problem! We\\'re doomed!!! Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there is a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT. Who\\'d have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated! I do not understand anything! When they look up stupid in the dictionary, there\\'ll be a picture of me! Shut up! Simpson, it is all up to you. It\\'s showtime! Okay, okay, think back to your training... Yes. Ooh, a side. What? Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it. This is all your fault! Okay, gotta pick a button. Pick a button. Pick a button. Uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... No, wait! Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? No, no! Eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... Eenie meenie minee... Moe. Hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor\\'s a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right button. Magic Johnson! Y\\'ello. Yeah. Well, thank you. Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy\\'s a hero but he was really just lucky? Thanks, Magic. Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I do not need it here at home. It tastes so bitter. It\\'s like ashes in my mouth! What\\'s your problem, boy? That four-eyes with the big nose? You do not need friends like that. What? What is it? What are you doing? Well, as long as it is quiet. Oooh, right next to the boss. Eh, he will never know who did it. Huh? Wha?... Their Eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what? But I really cannot tell them anything, sir. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? Did it work? Uh... ladies and... gentlemen... Um, Grace under pressure is no... Whew! Saved by the bell. All right. Eeenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe... If he hollers let him go, eenie meenie minee moe. Sure. Moe. You think it is him? What are you talking about? Of course he does. We could have seen a monkey. He\\'s talking funny talk. A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here. Mel Brooks is Jewish? Hey Krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what? Yeah, Krusty, tell us. Boy, you do not have to follow in my footsteps. Why you little... No, that is it. You\\'ve seen everything. Gladly. Hey, if you do not like it, go to Russia. Hey, are not you a little old for this? You\\'re not even wearing costumes. Here you go, kids. Lousy punks... Get a good haul this year? I am very, very proud of you kids. I would like to see that. What a dump. Why would Princess Grace live in a place like this? Eeuhgh. What is this thing? Oh yeah? How much? C\\'mom pal, I do not wanna hear your life story. Paw me! Why at that little shop, right over... there. Oh no, wait, it was over there. Don\\'t shoot, Don\\'t shoot. They\\'re souvenirs. Okay. Forget it, you two. As the pants- wearer of this house, I get the first wish. Marge, do not flake out on me. That monkey\\'s paw is gonna make our dreams come true. Ooh, a luxury car. Good baby. Good Maggie. Now you are talkin\\'! Woo hoo! C\\'mon, everybody. We\\'re going to the fanciest restaurant in town! Come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. I thought he was just being colorful. Lisa, that was very selfish of you. Ok, Ok. I will make a wish that cannot backfire. I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, And...AND! I do not want any zombie turkeys, I do not want to turn into a turkey myself, and I do not want any other weird surprises. You got it? Hey... Hmm. Not bad. Nice hot mustard... good bread... Turkey\\'s a little dry. The turkey\\'s a little dry?! Oh foul, accursed thing! What demon from the depths of hell created thee?! Yeah, but I gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... Yeah, that is what it is. Wanna try it? Heh, heh, heh. I wish I had a Monkey\\'s Paw. Hiya Bart!!! How\\'s my boy! Heh heh. Heh heh. It\\'s good that you made that awful thing, Bart. It\\'s real good. He gets it from your side of the family, you know. No monsters on my side. Come on... make it... make it... make it... please... please... please. Shut up boy. If they make this field goal I win fifty bucks. Slowly... slowly... do not make a sound... do not even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he is least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. End of monster. Heh heh heh. I am not nodding. It\\'s the air conditioning. Ouch! Good night, son. Well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back. Oh, ah, thanks boy. I love you, son. You both toilet-trained? Well, okay then... ... Four o\\'clock... Coupla hours I have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work. Huh? What? For what? How do you know I was sleeping? Camera? How hard can it be? Ooo, what job is that? Sheesh. What a slave driver. No. Bart bit me. I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly. I did not wake up. It\\'s all a dream. It\\'s just a dream! Umm. Spaghetti. Oh, I hate having two heads. Y\\'ello. Don\\'t worry, I know it is tonight. Uh... is not this the kind of thing your mother\\'s better at? Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed. Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer? Hurry, Moe, hurry! I have only got five minutes till the music store closes. Hey, do I tell you how to do your job? You know, if you tip the glass, there will not be so much foam on top. Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare. The moron next door closed early! Oh, me and my trenchant mouth. Hmm. \"Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!\" Yes! That\\'s it! Please, you have got to open that store. Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you are disappointing. Well I do not have one. I will have you know, I wrote it down. Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum! Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo! I dunno. No. No. No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one again? Whew, I would hate to be that kid\\'s father. Uh-oh. Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah! I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh. That cost eighty-eight dollars! Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that does not make it right, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. You did not mean that! No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed that she was alive. Okay. Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie. Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I am gonna -- you know -- go fruity. No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let\\'s see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I will buy her that pony she is always bugging me for. Marge, with today\\'s gasoline prices, we cannot afford not to buy a pony. Marge, I have got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa\\'s eyes, I do not see love anymore. See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes. Ha ha, you love me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm. Buh. Sneh. Excuse me, do you sell ponies? \"Scot-tish deer-hound.\" Hey, this is a dog! Now lady, I am buying this pony for my little girl, and I do not care what it costs. Half a million dollars?! Wow! I will take it! Uh, sure... let me write you a check. Is there a problem with that? Isn\\'t there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home? I-I\\'d like to borrow five thousand dollars. Mr. Burns, you do this personally? U-su-ry? I want to buy a pony. No. I need to get it for my little girl because she does not love me any more. Sorry. Of course. Simpson, you have done it again. Sounds like someone\\'s angling for a pony of her own. Because she stopped loving me. I know you love me. So you do not get squat. Hee hee hee hee. I have got it all figured out. By day it will roam free around the neighborhood. And at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage. That\\'s for the courts to decide. Marge, she loves me. Stable? That sounds expensive. This is what love costs a month? Oh nuts. I was hoping it would be money. Well you know, we are always buying Maggie vaccinations for diseases she does not even have. Nah, we are not gonna be doing that. First you did not want me to get the pony. Now, you want me to take it back. Make up your mind. Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays. Fine, I will. There\\'s plenty of money out there for a guy who is willing to work for it. Do you have any jewelry you do not need anymore? Need money. Need money. One Scratch-for-Cash, please. Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, come on, come on... Oh. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Three Liberty Bells! That\\'ll be TEN thousand dollars, Apu. Thank you. There it is. No. No! No! No! You cannot see... come on! No! Let go. You\\'re ripping it. Ohh... I need money. You\\'re looking for help? I am your man! Woo-hoo! ...Badge of honor. But I eat... Oh. Heh heh, the perfect crime. Marge, could we go in the other room? I did something last night I am not proud of and I do not want the kids to hear it. I will work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to spend as I please. Then I am off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy. Mmm... salty. No sir. Yes sir. I do not know. How long do horses live? Mustn\\'t sleep. Must monitor core. Y\\'ello. Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me? Going for... eight hour walk. Homer sleep now. Coming right up, sir. Yes, sir. Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money... You did? Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus! Awww. Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it! That baby changed our lives. Oooooh! That\\'s one clean tombstone. In the garage. Yeah, give us a break, Doctor. If stuff starts flying, just turn your head. Okay, okay, calm down. Okay, I will. I will. Patty, Selma, what a pleasant surprise. ... Expiration date: June, 1999... Uh, 2012, yeah. Shh! They\\'ll hear you. I do not know. Some guy I guess. How much? What\\'s the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you? Anything for my little girl. Bart! You cannot weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid. Ooooooh, McBain. Why? I just saw the best part. Just grab something. All these movies are great. Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman. Oh Marge. Uh, let us see, Bart\\'s friends... Well, there is the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who is always got his hands in his pockets. Okay. Hank. Hank... Jones. Steve McQueen. Next. Well, he is always chewing on that phone cord. Then he has no hobbies. Bart!... BART!!! You do not have any hobbies, do you boy? Well, that is what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing? Oh, that is a hobby! Oh, my God. I do not know jack about my boy... I am a bad father! I am also fat! I am Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero. Goodbye, son. Ho, ho... if he is as smart as he is funny, I am sold. Well, that is easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son? Huh? Oh, how I envy you! I have never been afraid of a little hard work. What boy? Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer. Bart!... I am gonna help you build that racer. Okay. No, I am gonna do it. But you can use me. I am good. I have built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree. What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you. Oh this is not working at all. It\\'s hopeless... Wait a second. Hmm... \"Cosby\\'s first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite.\" Huh? Oh, that sounds too complicated. All right, I will! Son, I do not think you should let me help you. Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons! You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit. I like our chances, son. This is my son and if he does not want to wear one you cannot make him! Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute! Are you nervous son? Okay Bart, we have got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I am gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks... Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we are Team Simpson. When did I ever teach you that? Don\\'t be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad. I will just sit here in \"Li\\'l Lightnin\\'\" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son. Ow. Why? What\\'s wrong? Oh, sure, I will take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you will ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, is not it, Lisa? Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker! No! I am not pouting, you are. Sorry. No. Can\\'t think of a thing. Leave me alone. Name your son\\'s hobbies. Building a soapbox racer... \"Name your child\\'s friends.\" Martin... Martin! I will curse that name \\'til the day I die... Huh? \"Who is your son\\'s heroe?\"... Three-time Soapbox Derby Champion Ronnie Beck! Wow, I am one question away from being a perfect father. \"Name another dad you talked to about parenting.\" Shut up Flanders. Flanders! Flanders, Flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating? Great, thanks. I talked to Flanders about parenting. I am a perfect father. Hold on, son, I\\'m-a coming! Do it for your old man, boy! That\\'s my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Wow, infotainment. He\\'s not so fat. Bart, why are you still up? Boy, they have got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego. What is it, boy? Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man. Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad? You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it is the law. Heh, heh. Run for it boy! That\\'s it. I am outta here. What\\'s the matter, Moe? Yeah, things are tough all over. Could I get a beer? Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself... One night Marge\\'s beastly sisters were showing slides from their latest vacation. As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink. Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment? I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle. In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids\\' cough syrup. It passed the first test: I did not go blind. I do not know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good. A \"Flaming Homer\". Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup? Try lighting it on fire. Well, it is called a \"Flaming... Moe, I have not seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it? Why yes I -- I will tell you what is wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him! Take that off this second! I need to talk to Moe. I did not even tell you my name. Homer Simpson. But-- Barney? You\\'re my kid\\'s teacher! No! Get away from me. Hey, Moe? I would rather have a \"Flaming Homer\". How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it. If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise. Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. You just lost yourself a customer! I said, you just lost yourself a customer! You just lost yourself a customer. You just lost yourself a customer, Moe! You just lost yourself a customer. You just lost yourself a customer. Ah, my new watering hole. A beer? Can I have a clean glass? Stupid Moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing... pug-nosed... Oooh! Look at me, I am making people happy. I am the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane! Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic. Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe... Moe. Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe... Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your Flaming Moe\\'s. All the time wondering, \"How does he do it?\" Well, I am going tell you. The secret ingredient is... Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children\\'s cough syrup! Hi, Moe. Where\\'s that waitress of yours?

I had a cat named Snowball -- She died, she died! Mom said she was sleeping -- She lied, she lied! Why oh why is my cat dead? Couldn\\'t that Chrysler hit me, instead? I had a hamster named Snuffy -- He died, -- Bart, in the split second before he died, I bet Scratchy appreciated his birthday present. You see how this relates to us? HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OVERLOOKED MIDDLE CHILD -- HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME. Bart, the entire town is howling for your blood, and before I join them I have one question: Today is my birthday -- you promised to get me something, and... and I am afraid to ask. I thought so. Oh, Bart, you... Dear Bart, I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. Perhaps if a professional so advises, I will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion, but rest assured it will be purely for show. Although I am aware you are looking at me, I would look exactly the same even if you weren\\'t. Huh... wha-- Bart, it is six a.m. Oh! This is the best present I ever got. Thank you, Bart. Thank you Michael. Bye, bye, Leon / Bye, roomie / Bye, Pardner / You\\'re a credit to Dementia! I do not think real checks have exclamation points. Daaad! Where did you get the idea for this, Mom? Wait, Dad! Hm. An essay contest. \"Children under twelve\"... \"Three hundred words\"... \"Fiercely pro-American.\" Sounds interesting. What would Ben Franklin say if he were alive today? He\\'d say... oh, think of a better opening. Not very well. Yes! Yes, Mom. Okay, America. Inspire me. Wow, a bald eagle. Hmm... Thanks for driving me to the contest, Dad. When America was born on that hot July day in 1776, the trees in Springfield Forest were tiny saplings, trembling towards the sun. And as they were nourished by Mother Earth, so too did our fledgling nation find strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice. Who would have thought such mighty oaks, or such a powerful nation, could grow out of something so fragile... so pure. Thank you. Okay. Bart! There\\'s no such thing as first bedsies. You just made that up. Iiiiiii Waaaaaannt... That one. Why? What\\'s wrong with it? No, really, what? What did you do to it? MOMMM! Have either of you ever run into any problems because of your superior ability? Ah, me too! Barbara Bush. Hello, sir. Only two. I checked. Mom? I am too excited to sleep. Anyone up for the Winifred Beecher Howe Memorial? An early crusader for women\\'s rights. She led the Floormop Rebellion of 1910. Later she appeared on the highly unpopular 75 cent piece. Okay, but you do not know what you are missing. \"I will iron your sheets when you iron out the inequities in your labor laws.\" Amen, sister. How could I read my essay now? I do not believe my own words. Honest Abe. He\\'ll show me the way. Mr. Lincoln, I... Mr. Lincoln, my name is Lisa Simpson, and I have a problem. Mr. Jefferson, my name is Lisa Simpson, and I have a problem. Sorry, sir. It\\'s just that... Uh, maybe I should be going. I caught you at a bad time. The truth must be told. I would like to read a different essay, if I may. \"The city of Washington was built on a stagnant swamp some 200 years ago, and very little has changed. It stank then, and it stinks now. Only today, it is the fetid stench of corruption that hangs in the air.\" \"And who did I see taking a bribe, but the \"Honorable\" Bob Arnold. But do not worry, Congressman, I am sure you can buy all the votes you need with your dirty money. And this will be one nation, under the dollar, with liberty and justice for none.\" I am sorry, Dad. I could not think of a nice way to say America stinks. I cannot believe it! The system works. Bart! The Flanders are having a beef-a-thon! Incredible Ned-ibles! Maude-acious vittles!. Dad, do you know what Schadenfreude is? It\\'s the German term for \"shameful joy\" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others. Sour grapes. Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it! Hey, quit it, quit it, quit it! M-o-o-o-m! You change it. Okay, okay. But Bart -- I am sure you did nothing to discourage this, you scavenger of human misery. Hey!! You give that back. That belongs to me! That\\'s mine! Hey, stop that. Not any more. You punks are about to get a taste of your own medicine. This is my brother... and he knows Karate. Yeah, just keep laughing, it only makes him madder. Come on, Bart, start them off with the touch of death and go from there. It\\'s funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right. What are you so happy about? No one wants your stupid police badge, Bart. I am gonna eat EIGHT pieces of chocolate. I think this is something Bart would really have enjoyed. But it is the only way he will learn. Bart, is your boss a crook? Dad, I think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and Larry King. Bart, that is so sweet. May I see the card? Hey there ten-year old. I could not afford to get you a new drum... ...so how about a nice pair of bongos? Ewww. Bart, you are not laughing. Too subtle? A role model in my very own home. How convenient. Maybe you ate a clove. How Zen. Looking at you with quiet awe. I will, Mr. Gumbel. But if you will excuse me, I am profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick. Uh, excuse me, I have the chocolate milk. He\\'s just a little nervous. He has to give a speech tomorrow on \"How To Keep Cool In A Crisis.\" Our dad... now he belongs to the ages. No, Dad, Krusty is our guest. Your pratfalls and Punchinello antics are not necessary here. Why do not we let our guest do it? No, Dad, that is Hebrew. Krusty must be Jewish. Dad, There are many prominent Jewish entertainers including Lauren Bacall, Dinah Shore, William Shatner, and Mel Brooks. Poor Krusty, he is like a black velvet painting come to life. Come on... Krusty, please continue. That is so sad. A man who envies our family is a man who needs help. Let\\'s move. No, no. We\\'re not converting, we just want to find a Rabbi Krustofsky. I did not know that. Oh yeah, it is all the kids talk about on Monday at school. I bet the rabbi misses Krusty. Excuse us, Rabbi Krustofsky? Bart, we are gonna have to out smart him. Bart, we have been going about this all wrong. What\\'s the one thing rabbis prize above everything else? No Bart. Knowledge. We\\'re gonna hit him where it hurts. Right in the Judaica. This looks good Bart. Take it to him. Not quite. I got some dynamite stuff from Rabbi Simon ben Eleazar. Here you go, Bart. It\\'s a long shot, but, that is all I can do without learning ancient Hebrew. Bart! I am not gonna learn ancient Hebrew. There, there, Rabbi. It\\'s not too late. I did not select this costume for mobility. I wore it to salute the noble native American of the Pacific Northwests... YAHHH! Oh yeah, three bad nightmares. Dad, that is Monaco. No, Bart. Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth. Oh, no! Maggie made a wish! Yaaayyy!! I wish for world peace. I had a bad dream. Could I sleep in your bed? Bart... Bart... I will give you a candy necklace. Thanks, Bart. Morning. Mom! Dad! Can we sleep with you? Hey, here is a good job, Dad. Oh wait, you have to know how to operate a ultrasonic lithotryptor. Mom, what is wrong? Whayda ya know, she is right. Don\\'t forget dad, tonight my class is having an all you can eat spaghetti dinner. Dad, I am calling about the school talent show. No. Dad, I broke my last saxophone reed, and I need you to get me a new one. I called her. She\\'s not home. I also tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement. Mom, where is he? If I do not get that reed I will sound terrible. It\\'s not my fault. It\\'s the reed. I am done. I am sorry dad, I do not feel much like eating. I forgive you. No. I didn\\'t. I love you, Dad! Snowball II... Santa\\'s Little Helper... this is Princess. Please do not exclude her because she is different. Dad, no! Dad, I think Princess belongs in a stable. Father, you have made me the happiest girl who ever lived. Wait, Dad, I have got something for you. You\\'re so beautiful. Oh look. You have not touched your salt lick. Num num, good salt lick. This next song is also about a girl and her pony. It\\'s called \"Wildfire.\" I just called to say I love you, Dad. What\\'s wrong with Dad? No. You\\'re gonna make me give up Princess? All the years I have lobbied to be treated like an adult has blown up in my face. She likes a little carrot after her oats. And she really likes it when you scratch her behind the ear. And if you are playing the radio, she likes contemporary adult in the morning and easy listening at night. Please take good care of my Princess. I will never forget you. Dad, you do not have to do this. Dad, I understand the sacrifice you have made for me. That\\'s why I gave up the pony. Hmmm hmmm. There\\'s a big dumb animal I love even more than that horse. I mean you, you dummy. Giddyup, Dad. Yes. Everything. Uh... take us to the video store. But, Dad, I cannot find \"Happy Little Elves in Tinkly Winkly Town\". Dad, can you take me to Dr. Hibbert\\'s office? Oh, nothing. I just scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I am being a little anal, but barefoot season\\'s coming up and there is a world of rusty nails out there. You should smell his room. That looks like an Olympic torch to me. Your husband could be an Olympic athlete who will go on to have a great acting career. The wax never lies. You\\'re telling who? Come here, Maggie.

Her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her Daddy. That was our wedding. Children, it is time for you to go to bed. Homie, did you straighten everything out...? Homer! You promised! Homer, please. We\\'ve never thrown a party. Now we are gonna pay back all the friends who have invited us to their homes. Oh! They\\'re here! How does everything look? Do we have enough glasses? Homer! Homer! Put a record on! Children! Go! Now, Homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. Remember last year at the Winfield\\'s party when you threw up in the laundry hamper? I must apologize for my husband. Hmmm. thank you. I will, Dr. Hibbert. Thanks for coming. I have never been so embarrassed in my life. Come here! Shhh. I want to make sure the kids do not hear. When I was young, I always hated knowing my parents were fighting. Homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night? Homer, I like to think that I am a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. But last night, you did not just cross that line, you threw up on it! I am going to church alone today. You\\'re going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred him for life. We\\'ll be there! We\\'re going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and that is all. No fishing. Oh, that must be the babysitter. Hello. I am Mrs. Simpson. Oh my. Where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice? Grampa? Grampa, could you do something? Well, I was wondering. Do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? I would not ask, except I am desperate. Now, if Maggie runs a fever, you call this number. If she sticks her finger in an electrical socket, call this number. And if she drinks pine cleanser, call this... All right. All right. Goodbye, children. And behave yourselves. Call this number if Grampa falls in the bathtub. Hello, Reverend. We\\'re glad we could come. Oh, hello Helen. Oh, Homer. Well, it is not that I do not love the guy. I am always sticking up for him. It\\'s just that he is so self-centered. He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes... He blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle... ... He drinks out of the carton. He never changes the baby. When he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. Oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. I guess that is it. Oh no. Wait. He kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. That\\'s all I can think of right now. I guess you are all tired and I want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest. Homer, you are sneaking out to go fishing? I cannot believe your selfishness. You can go fishing anytime, but we are here trying to save our marriage. You\\'re thinking about fishing, even when I am talking... right now. Right? Yes. Get back in bed. Sure. Homer? Do I have to do this? We came to this retreat because I thought our marriage was in trouble, but I never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. Homer, how can you expect me to believe.... To who? All this fish represents is just how selfish you are. Oh yeah, sure. Ohhh, Homer. Oh my, the house looks wonderful. Grampa, what is your secret? Kids, could you lighten up a little? We\\'re here! So, did you kids have fun? Ohhh. Homer! Don\\'t gloat, Homer. You know, Bart, when I was your age, the one thing I wanted more than anything in the world was a Child-sized Electric Lightbulb Oven. My parents would not give me the money, so I went to my sisters, Patty and Selma... For months, I worked and worked, while my sisters smoked and smoked... But the big day finally came. And because I would worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good. So maybe a part-time job is the answer. The poor boy is so desperate. He wants to earn money to buy a comic book. I do not think so. Did you make any money? Well, I think what you are doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. The poor old thing does not have anybody. I thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s\\'mores. Homer, it is really coming down. Could you check on the boys? Boys, you better come in the house. You do not want to get the sniffles. Now come on... You can play your little tie-up game inside. I have got some cocoa on the stove. Who wants imitation marshmallows? What are you doing, honey? Lisa, we did the best we could... What\\'s a zebu? A-Positive. A mother knows everything about her family. Four B. Sixteen permanent, eight baby. XL. I do not want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three. Butterscotch and imitation butterscotch. Glow in the dark monster make-up. Oh, Homie, you have lots of hair... Why did you want to know your blood type? Bart does. Bart, you have to help someone in need. It\\'s the only decent thing to do. The meaning of what? Homer, you do not do things like that to be rewarded. You do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand. We got exactly what we wanted out of this: We gave an old man a second chance. But he is your boss. Do you have to mail it right this minute? You\\'re still angry, Homer. Why do not you sleep on it? Please, Homie? For me? Homer... Breakfast is ready. Oh... thank you. Homer, I do not think it is in the cornstarch canister. Homer, you encouraged him. You should be strangling yourself. Honey, what is done is done. No matter what happens, we will pull through. We always do. Oh, my! It\\'s Mr. Burns. It does not do anything. Whatever it does, it is doing it now. Homer, it is the thought that counts. The moral of this story is, \"A good deed is its own reward.\" Well then, I guess the moral is, \"No good deed goes unrewarded.\" Well... then I guess the moral is, \"The squeaky wheel gets the grease.\" But it certainly was a memorable few days! Bart, watch Maggie while I get the laundry. Maggie! Bart, I asked you to watch your sister! I washed it. Now Homer, do not panic. You have plenty of white shirts. I do not know how this could have happened. Homer, please. No one\\'s going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work. Homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. I cannot fill this out for you. Oh my God! Mother was right. I told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house. I said crazy house! Crazy house! Crazy house! Doctor, if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son, Bart, you would see how sane he is. Oh, Homie. Well, at least we got a free sample of Reading Digest. No, it is not the truth, Homer. It\\'s well documented that women are safer drivers than men. You\\'ve certainly taken a shine to that magazine. Homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article. Homie... Put down your magazine for a minute... I thought you might want to snuggle. Thank you, Homie. It certainly has enriched our lives. Bart, maybe this is something you would like to do, too. How\\'s it going, honey? Well, when I used to get stuck like this, I would go for a bike ride. Do kids go on bike rides anymore? I do not know, I thought maybe bikes were not cool anymore. Do kids still use that word, \"cool\"? Oooh, look, Homer. The IRS. Here we are, kids! The Watergate. Homer, look! They give you a shower cap, and body gel and bathrobes... Ooh, and a welcoming mint on your pillow. Wow, the President\\'s bathroom! Lisa, the contest is not for three hours. I know, honey, but just sit still. Lisa, what is gotten into you? Imprisoned Congressman becomes born-again Christian. No, that was about the budget gap. This is the trading gap. I think it means he is having a barbecue. He\\'s trying to be friendly. You know, if you gave Ned Flanders a chance -- We cannot hold it against him, just because he has things a little better than we do -- Oh, Homer. Hi, Ned. Homer sends his apologies, but uh... there was some important work at the plant that only he could take care of. Bart, how many hours a day do you watch TV? Don\\'t you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise? That\\'s the problem. Even as we speak, millions of children are staring at the TV instead of getting some much-needed exercise. Those children\\'s parents should be ashamed of themselves. That sounds fine, Bart. So Bart, what did you learn in karate school today? Bart, do not use the touch of death on your sister. Homer, this is the Flanders\\' entire living room set. How much did you pay for this? Seventy-five dollars? Ned must be desperate! You got a job? Doing what? Bart, your father and I do not want you doing that. Homer, say something. Homer? Homer! I know it is good for a boy to have a part-time job, but I am not sure about the people Bart\\'s working for. I thinks they are criminals. Well, Bart\\'s been acting very strangely. And that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks. How long does it take to deliver a pizza? Homer, I want you to go down to that club and talk to them. Just see what kind of people they are. Please, Homie? Homer, what did you find out? Oh, Bart. Why could not you have gotten a paper route like other boys. Principal Skinner! Well, they said they changed it just enough so they do not have to pay us. Oh my Lord! Homie, please be all right. Dear Lord, if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, I will try to be a better Christian. I do not know what I can do... Ummm, oooh, the next time there is a canned food drive I will give the poor something they would actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix. Homer, did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham? And what is all this? \"For heroic competence... for narrowly averting a melt-down and proving, without question, that nuclear power is completely safe... Employee-of-the-Month!\" Ohh, Homer! How are you enjoying your ham, Homie? Hmm, it is actually more of a honey glaze -- Bart, do not feed your sister hotels! I think that game is too old for her. Why do not you go play with Milhouse? You mean you still have not made up with him? Mrs. Van Houten, I am Bart\\'s mother -- we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint. Look, I know Bart can be a handful but I also know what he is like inside. He\\'s got a spark. It\\'s not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things... Well, I cannot defend everything he does. But let us face it, all Bart and Milhouse have is each other. They\\'re too young for girls. And they are a popular target for bullies. And in the Christmas pageant, they are always sheep. Please, please, let them be friends! Well, I knew his mother would come to her senses.. What makes you think I did it? You be good. Hello? Oh hello, Mrs. Pennycandy. Oh, dear. This is the fifth time he is cancelled. How can he hurt someone who loves him so? Well, thank you for calling. Good-bye. Sweetie, I am sorry, but Krusty is not coming to dinner again. Bart, wipe your feet. I have got some good news. Krusty the Clown is coming to dinner tonight. Yes. Who wants to say grace? Krusty, why do not you tell us what is wrong? You\\'ll feel better. Well, look at the time. Almost midnight. Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home. We\\'re home! Now children, you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for... If you eat too much you will have nightmares. Look everybody! My purse exploded! Ugghh, Homer. Where did you get that ugly thing? Homer, there is something I do not like about that severed hand. Oh, my land! Ooh, a new pacifier. Homer, maybe fame and fortune are not as bad as they say. Oh Homer, this is awful. Good morning, dear. Much better! Oh good, the curtains are on fire! Now had not you better get ready for school? Bart! That\\'s it, young man. You\\'re coming with me... Please? My goodness, what is wrong? It\\'s your father, he is missing. He\\'s been gone for two days. Did you have a nightmare, Homie? Don\\'t worry, honey, I am sure your father is... Maybe. No. That\\'s a long shot. Bingo. Don\\'t worry, he will be here. Look Homer, Lisa\\'s taking her first steps. Yes. Did you hear that, Homer? Homer, if you want to make up with Lisa just spend some time with her. Homie, you have got to stop looking for the quick fix. If you keep spending time with Lisa, she will forgive you. We cannot afford to buy a pony. That\\'s ridiculous. That\\'s no reason to buy a pony! Stick to the subject. Let\\'s be realistic. A pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is. You sound like you are going to buy a pony. Promise me you won\\'t. What was that? Was that a yes or a no? Those are not even words! I am very upset with you. Homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse? That\\'s illegal. Hmm, oh dear, we are in serious trouble here. We\\'re just going to have to cut down on luxuries. Actually, I was thinking we could cut down on your beer. Then I am afraid there is no choice but to give up the pony back. Homer... All right. You got us into this, you get us out. Homer, where have you been? I was so worried. Homie, how long do you plan to do this? Thirty years? He\\'s just exhausted. Lisa, do you know how much it costs to keep a pony? Well, it is a lot. In fact, your father had to take a second job. The Kwik-E-Mart. Lisa, I hope you realize that your father cannot keep this up. Lisa, we cannot make you give up that pony. No, Bart. No one\\'s going to make her. This is something Lisa has to decide for herself. Homer, can you get the door? It\\'s my sisters. Homer, be nice. What\\'s the matter, cannot you find a hair style you like? Ed Asner? Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again? Who\\'s using the power tools? Well, we are going to the beauty parlor. Maybe you should do something with the kids while I am gone. I do not know. Homie, we are back. Homer, could you turn off the TV? There\\'s a little test I want you to take. This is from the National Fatherhood Institute. It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father. Question one: \"Name one of your child\\'s friends...\" They want a name, Homer, not a vague description. Hank?! Hank who? Homer, you made that up. Question two: \"Who is your son\\'s hero?\" That\\'s your hero. \"Name another dad you talked to about parenting.\" What are your son\\'s hobbies? He has not done that since he was two. Oh really? Well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see. Now, do not pout. Don\\'t you at least have something to say to Bart? Homer! I have always said you were a good father. I have always defended you when people put you down. But I guess I was wrong. You are a bad father. Bart, you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner. Honey, what is wrong? Homie, why do not you just go down to Moe\\'s and talk to him? I bet he would be willing to share some of his success with you. So, Mr. Hutz, does my husband have a case? Well Homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy. Well, duh. Bart, are you going to moe the lawn today? I moe, I moe. Of course. All work and moe play makes Moe a moe moe.',\n",

Milhouse, the acids in your hands could damage the newsprint. We want to keep this comic forever, so the last one alive will have the honor of being buried with it. I meant years from now. I have to go to the bathroom, Bart. Bart, is this how you treat all your guests? I do not know. Is it worse than what you do with people that have to go to the bathroom? Bart, the comic! You know, if you guys had not tied me up, I could be saving the comic as we speak. I would raise my hand, Mrs. Simpson, if I could. It\\'s no use, fellows. Another comic book has returned to the earth from whence it came. Milhouse, I would like to express my appreciation for Saturday. Jelly bean baskets, personalized noisemakers -- those little touches are what made it enduring. A conventional design. In between some other projects. Well, gentlemen, if you will excuse me, I have booked some time at the wind tunnel. Attention, everyone. I say to those who question the value of the space program... Behold! You know, Bart, I do not care who wins, as long as one of us beats that guy. Oh my. I did not realize this hill was so high. Could I have another minute -- Aaah! Aieee! Deploy, damn you, deploy! It hurts! It hurts! Owee-owee-owee-ow! But that means I cannot possibly race! Save your palliative cliches for the next poor sap, Doctor. Thanks, Bart. That racer transformed me into the twisted creature you see before you. I will never race again. Even if I wanted to, I am in no shape to do it. Unless... Bart, will you drive my car? Tell me something I do not know. Mr. Simpson, you have every right to be angry. But rest assured, your son loves you... Bart, if she breaks up on you, steer away from the grandstands, or else you might kill hundreds of innocent spectators. Bart what did I just tell you? What is the matter with you? Forget about your father. You\\'re driving for me now! I might remind you both, I did design that racer. The driver is essentially ballast.

Hugh Jass, Oh, somebody check the men\\'s room for a Hugh Jass. Telephone. Homer, I am sorry you are mad at me, but this is not personal. This is business. What? I am sorry.

Oh, licking envelopes can be fun! All you have to do is make a game of it. Well... for example... you could see how many you can lick in an hour, and then try to break that record. Yes... well... get started. You did not believe me when I said it would be fun, did you? What? Hmm... Well there is still a minute to go... oh, why not! But do not you tell your teacher I let you go home early. What\\'s this? What are you boys doing? I do not have an appointment with any large men -- I am PRINCIPAL Skinner, yes. And how, may I ask, did you get past the hall monitors? Stop! I suppose you are all wondering where I have been. It all started a week ago. I was at my desk, revising and updating the school dress codes, when... I was suddenly confronted by a gang of toughs acting on behalf of one Bart Simpson. Or so they said. Get out! To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. But suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently. For the next week I stayed alive by eating my mother\\'s delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand. I made a game of it, seeing how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that record. Occasionally the police arrived to search my home. I shouted until I was hoarse, but they could not hear me. I\\'M IN HERE!!! Finally I realized if I was ever going to get out of there, I would have to do it myself. I formed a crude rocket from a discarded cigar tube. And remembering an experiment from my days as a fourth grade science teacher, I concocted a fuel from baking soda and the juice of discarded lemon wedges. The rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide, dragging behind it the end of a vacuum cleaner cord. I grabbed on to the vacuum cleaner, pushed the cord retractor button and was on my way to freedom. And that is my courageous story. They called me old-fashioned for teaching the duck and cover. But who is laughing now? Your attention please. This is Principal Skinner. Bart, this one\\'s for you. Hello ma baby, hello ma honey, hello my ragtime gal... Send me a kiss by wire.. One... more... time! HELLO MA BABY... HELLO MA HONEY... HELLO MY RAGTIME GAL. DOUBLETIME, NOW. SEND ME A KISS BY WIRE... Well, you are in for a whale of a show tonight. I would like to point out that the doors are now locked, so you parents cannot sneak out of the show after your own child has performed. Oh, and let me caution the people in the first five rows, you will get wet. Oh well, make sure you return those chairs to the cafeteria, Kim. I am not kidding. Terrible, just terrible. You know, they seem to get worse every year. Wonderful. You know, I think this is the best batch we have ever had. I really do. And now, here is Bart Simpson, The Boy of a Thousand Voices. That young man just became the Boy of a Thousand Days Detention. This act is over! Well, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to put this filth behind us, and let us all enjoy Lisa Simpson\\'s rendition of \"Stormy Leather -- ah, Weather.\" That\\'ll do. Oh yes, of course.
